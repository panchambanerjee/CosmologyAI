      "Compatibility of JWST results with exotic halos \n",
      " The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is unveiling astounding results about the first few hundred million years of life of the Universe, delivering images of galaxies at very high redshifts. Here, we develop a UV luminosity function model for high-redshift galaxies, considering parameters such as the stellar formation rate, dust extinction, and halo mass function. Calibration of this luminosity function model using UV luminosity data at redshifts z = 4-7 yields optimal parameter values. Testing the model against data at higher redshifts reveals successful accommodation of the data at z = 8-9, but challenges emerge at z~13. Our findings suggest a negligible role of dust extinction at the highest redshifts, prompting a modification of the stellar formation rate to incorporate a larger fraction of luminous objects per massive halo, consistently with similar recent studies. This effect could be attributed to mundane explanations such as unknown evolution of standard astrophysics at high redshift or to the existence of exotic objects at high redshift. We comment on this latter possibility.\n"

      " We combine measurements of galaxy velocities from galaxy surveys with measurements of the Weyl potential from the Dark Energy Survey to test the consistency of General Relativity at cosmological scales. Taking the ratio of two model-independent observables - the growth rate of structure and the Weyl potential - we obtain new measurements of the $E_G$ statistic with precision of $5.8-10.7\\%$ at four different redshifts. These measurements provide a considerable improvement to past measurements of $E_G$. They confirm the validity of General Relativity at three redshifts, while displaying a tension of $2.5\\sigma$ at $z=0.47$ as a consequence of the tension found in the measurements of the Weyl potential. Contrary to conventional methods that rely on a common galaxy sample with spectroscopic resolution to measure two types of correlations, we directly combine two observables that are independent of the galaxy bias. This provides a novel approach to testing the relation between the geometry of our Universe and the motion of galaxies with improved precision.\n"

      " The cosmological principle posits that the universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, implying all matter share the same rest frame. This principle suggests that velocity estimates of our motion from various sources should agree with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole's inferred velocity of 370 km/s. Yet, for over two decades, analyses of different radio galaxy and quasar catalogs have reported velocities with amplitudes in notable tension with the CMB dipole. In a blind analysis of BOSS and eBOSS spectroscopic data from galaxies and quasars across $0.2<z<2.2$, we applied a novel dipole estimator for a tomographic approach, robustly correcting biases and quantifying uncertainties with state-of-the-art mock catalogs. Our results, indicating a velocity of $v = 353^{+123}_{-111}$ km/s, closely align with the CMB dipole, demonstrating a $1.4\\sigma$ agreement. This finding provides significant empirical support for the cosmological principle, affirming our motion's consistency with the CMB across vast cosmic distances.\n"
