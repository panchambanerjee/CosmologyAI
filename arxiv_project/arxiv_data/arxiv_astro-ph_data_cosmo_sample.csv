1212.5270,HeII emitters in the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey: PopIII star formation or   peculiar stellar populations in galaxies at 2<z<4.6?,"The aim of this work is to identify HeII emitters at 2<z<4.6 and to constrain the source of the hard ionizing continuum that powers the HeII emission. We have assembled a sample of 277 galaxies with a high quality spectroscopic redshift at 2<z<4.6 from the VVDS survey, and we have identified 39 HeII1640A emitters. We study their spectral properties, measuring the fluxes, equivalent widths (EW) and FWHM for most relevant lines. About 10% of galaxies at z~3 show HeII in emission, with rest frame equivalent widths EW0~1-7A, equally distributed between galaxies with Lya in emission or in absorption. We find 11 high-quality HeII emitters with unresolved HeII line (FWHM_0<1200km/s), 13 high-quality emitters with broad He II emission (FWHM_0>1200km/s), 3 AGN, and an additional 12 possible HeII emitters. The properties of the individual broad emitters are in agreement with expectations from a W-R model. On the contrary, the properties of the narrow emitters are not compatible with such model, neither with predictions of gravitational cooling radiation produced by gas accretion. Rather, we find that the EW of the narrow HeII line emitters are in agreement with expectations for a PopIII star formation, if the episode of star formation is continuous, and we calculate that a PopIII SFR of 0.1-10 Mo yr-1 only is enough to sustain the observed HeII flux. We conclude that narrow HeII emitters are either powered by the ionizing flux from a stellar population rare at z~0 but much more common at z~3, or by PopIII star formation. As proposed by Tornatore et al. (2007), incomplete ISM mixing may leave some small pockets of pristine gas at the periphery of galaxies from which PopIII may form, even down to z~2 or lower. If this interpretation is correct, we measure at z~3 a SFRD in PopIII stars of 10^6Mo yr^-1 Mpc^-3 qualitatively comparable to the value predicted by Tornatore et al. (2007).",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"HeII emitters in the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey: PopIII star formation or   peculiar stellar populations in galaxies at 2<z<4.6?

1901.01041,Kinetic Field Theory applied to Vector-Tensor Gravity,"The formation of cosmic structures is an important diagnostic for both the dynamics of the cosmological model and the underlying theory of gravity. At the linear level of these structures, certain degeneracies remain between different cosmological models and alternative gravity theories. It is thus indispensable to study the non-linear, late-time evolution of cosmic structures to try and disentangle their fundamental properties caused by the cosmological model or gravity theory itself. Conventionally, non-linear cosmic structure formation is studied by means of computationally expensive numerical simulations. Since these inevitably suffer from shot noise and are too time consuming to systematically scrutinize large parameter spaces of cosmological models or fundamental theories, analytical methods are needed to overcome the limitations of numerical simulations.   Recently, a new analytic approach to non-linear cosmic structure formation has been proposed based on kinetic field theory for classical particle ensembles. Within this theory, a closed, analytic, non-perturbative and parameter-free equation could be derived for the non-linear power spectrum of cosmic density perturbations which agrees very well with numerically simulated results to wave numbers $k\lesssim10\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at redshift $z = 0$.

1607.02094,Magneto-optic effects of the Cosmic Microwave Background,"Generation of magneto-optic effects by the interaction of the CMB with cosmic magnetic fields is studied. Effects which generate polarization such as the Cotton-Mouton effect, vacuum polarization and photon-pseudoscalar mixing in external magnetic field are studied. Considering the CMB linearly polarized at decoupling time, it is shown that photon-pseudoscalar mixing in external magnetic field, the Cotton-Mouton effect in plasma and the vacuum polarization in cosmic magnetic field, would generate elliptic polarization of the CMB depending on the photon frequency and magnetic field strength. Among standard magneto-optic effects, the Cotton-Mouton effect in plasma turns out to be the dominant effect in the generation of CMB elliptic polarization in the low frequency part $\nu_0 \sim 10^8-10^9$ Hz with degree of circular polarization $P_C(T_0)\simeq 10^{-10}-10^{-6}$ for magnetic field amplitude $B_{e0}\sim 100\, \text{nG}-1$ nG. The vacuum polarization in magnetic field is the dominant process in the high frequency part $\nu_0\geq 10^{10}$ Hz where the degree of circular polarization at present is $P_C(T_0)\lesssim 10^{-11}$ in the best scenario. It is shown that photon-pseudoscalar particle mixing in cosmic magnetic field generates elliptic polarization of the CMB as well and even in the case of initially unpolarized CMB.

1005.2413,Galaxy Clustering in the Completed SDSS Redshift Survey: The Dependence   on Color and Luminosity,"We measure the luminosity and color dependence of galaxy clustering in the SDSS DR7 main galaxy sample, focusing on the projected correlation function w_p(r_p) of volume-limited samples. We interpret our measurements using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling assuming a Lambda-CDM cosmology. The amplitude of w_p(r_p) grows slowly with luminosity for L < L_* and increases sharply at higher luminosities, with bias factor b(>L)=1.06+0.23(L/L_*)^{1.12}. At fixed luminosity, redder galaxies have a stronger and steeper w_p(r_p), a trend that runs steadily from the bluest galaxies to the reddest galaxies. The individual luminosity trends for the red and blue galaxy populations are strikingly different. Blue galaxies show a slow but steady increase of w_p(r_p) with luminosity, at all scales. The large-scale clustering of red galaxies shows little luminosity dependence until a sharp increase at L > 4L_*, but the lowest luminosity red galaxies (0.04-0.25 L_*) show very strong clustering on scales r_p < 2 Mpc/h. Most of the observed trends can be naturally understood within the LCDM+HOD framework. The growth of w_p(r_p) with luminosity reflects an overall shift in the halo mass scale, in particular an increase in the minimum host halo mass Mmin. The mass at which a halo has, on average, one satellite galaxy brighter than L is M_1 ~ 17 Mmin(L) over most of the luminosity range. The growth and steepening of w_p(r_p) for redder galaxies reflects the increasing fraction of galaxies that are satellite systems in high mass halos instead of central systems in low mass halos, a trend that is especially marked at low luminosities.

2008.08519,Building Halo Merger Trees from the Q Continuum Simulation,"Cosmological N-body simulations rank among the most computationally intensive efforts today. A key challenge is the analysis of structure, substructure, and the merger history for many billions of compact particle clusters, called halos. Effectively representing the merging history of halos is essential for many galaxy formation models used to generate synthetic sky catalogs, an important application of modern cosmological simulations. Generating realistic mock catalogs requires computing the halo formation history from simulations with large volumes and billions of halos over many time steps, taking hundreds of terabytes of analysis data. We present fast parallel algorithms for producing halo merger trees and tracking halo substructure from a single-level, density-based clustering algorithm. Merger trees are created from analyzing the halo-particle membership function in adjacent snapshots, and substructure is identified by tracking the ""cores"" of merging halos -- sets of particles near the halo center. Core tracking is performed after creating merger trees and uses the relationships found during tree construction to associate substructures with hosts. The algorithms are implemented with MPI and evaluated on a Cray XK7 supercomputer using up to 16,384 processes on data from HACC, a modern cosmological simulation framework.

However, proposed models of the phenomenon are either numerically expensive or too inaccurate to achieve unbiased inferences of cosmological parameters even at mildly-nonlinear scales of the data. As an alternative to constructing accurate galaxy bias models, requiring understanding galaxy formation, we propose to construct likelihood distributions for Bayesian forward modeling approaches that are insensitive to linear, scale-dependent bias and provide robustness against model misspecification. We use maximum entropy arguments to construct likelihood distributions designed to account only for correlations between data and inferred quantities. By design these correlations are insensitive to linear galaxy biasing relations, providing the desired robustness. The method is implemented and tested within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach.

2206.06480,Chameleon Screening in Cosmic Voids,"A key goal in cosmology in the upcoming decade will be to form a better understanding of the accelerated expansion of the Universe. Upcoming surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), Euclid and the Square Killometer Array (SKA) will deliver key datasets required to tackle this and other puzzles in contemporary cosmology. With this data, constraints of unprecedented power will be put on different models of dark energy and modified gravity. In this context it is crucial to understand how screening mechanisms, which hide the deviations of these theories from the predictions of general relativity in local experiments, affect structure formation. In this work we approach this problem by using a combination of analytic and numerical methods to describe chameleon screening in the context of cosmic voids. We apply a finite element method (FEM) code, SELCIE, to solve the chameleon equation of motion for a number of void profiles derived from observational data and simulations. The obtained results indicate a complex relationship between the properties of cosmic voids and the size of the chameleon acceleration of a test particle. We find that the fifth force on a test particle in a void is primarily related to the depth and the inner density gradient of the void. For realistic void profiles, the obtained chameleon-to-Newtonian acceleration ratios range between $a_{\phi}/a_{\rm Newt} \approx 10^{-6} - 10^{-5}$. However, it should be noted that in unusually deep voids with large inner density gradients, the acceleration ratios can be significantly higher. Similarly, other chameleon models, such as $f(R)$ Hu-Sawicki theory allow for significantly higher acceleration ratios.

The collapsar model explains GRB formation via the collapse of a rapidly rotating massive star with $M> 30M_\odot$ into a black hole, which may imply a decrease of SFR at high redshift. However, we find that the \emph{Swift} GRBs during 2005-2012 are biased tracing the SFR, including a factor about $(1+z)^{0.5}$, which is in agreement with recent results. After taking this factor, the SFR derived from GRBs does not show steep drop up to $z\sim 9.4$. We consider the GRBs produced by rapidly rotating metal-poor stars with low masses to explain the high-redshift GRB rate excess.

Contrary to classical, optically-selected quasars, the X-ray properties of red (i.e. with J-Ks> 1.7 and R-Ks> 4) broad line quasars are still quite unexplored, although there is a growing consensus that, due to moderate obscuration, these objects can offer a unique view of spectral components typically swamped by the AGN light in normal, blue quasars. The XMM-Newton observation discussed here has definitely confirmed the complexity of the X-ray spectrum revealing the presence of a cold (or mildly-ionized) absorber with Nh ~10^{22} cm^-2 along the line of sight to the nucleus and a Compton reflection component accompanied by an intense Fe K emission line in this quasar with a Lum(2-10) ~5 x 10^{44} erg/s.

Contrary to classical, optically-selected quasars, the X-ray properties of red (i.e. with J-Ks> 1.7 and R-Ks> 4) broad line quasars are still quite unexplored, although there is a growing consensus that, due to moderate obscuration, these objects can offer a unique view of spectral components typically swamped by the AGN light in normal, blue quasars. The XMM-Newton observation discussed here has definitely confirmed the complexity of the X-ray spectrum revealing the presence of a cold (or mildly-ionized) absorber with Nh ~10^{22} cm^-2 along the line of sight to the nucleus and a Compton reflection component accompanied by an intense Fe K emission line in this quasar with a Lum(2-10) ~5 x 10^{44} erg/s. A soft-excess component is also required by the data. The match between the column density derived by our spectral analysis and that expected on the basis of reddening due to the dust suggests the possibility that both absorptions occur in the same medium. FTM 0830+3759 is characterized by an extinction/absorption-corrected X-ray-to-optical flux ratio alphaox = -2.3, that is steeper than expected on the basis of its UV luminosity. These findings indicate that the X-ray properties of FTM 0830+3759 differs from those typically observed for optically-selected broad line quasars with comparable hard X-ray luminosity."

In addition to measuring the clustering of unobscured ($N_{\rm H} < 10^{22}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$) and moderately obscured ($10^{22} \leq N_{\rm H} < 10^{23.5}$) AGNs, we also targeted highly obscured sources ($N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{23.5}$) up to redshifts of $z=3$. We have compiled one of the largest samples of X-ray-selected AGNs from a total of eight deep XMM/Chandra surveys. We measured the clustering as a function of both AGN obscuration and redshift using the projected two-point correlation function, $w_{\rm p}(r_{\rm p})$. We modeled the large-scale clustering signal, measured the AGN bias, $b(z, N_{\rm H})$, and interpreted it in terms of the typical AGN host dark matter halo, $M_{\rm halo}(z, N_{\rm H}$). We find no significant dependence of AGN clustering on obscuration, suggesting similar typical masses of the hosting halos as a function of $N_{\rm H}$. This result matches expectations of AGN unification models, in which AGN obscuration depends mainly on the viewing angle of the obscuring torus.

We find that irrespective of obscuration, an increase in AGN bias with redshift is slower than the expectation for a constant halo mass and instead follows the growth rate of halos, known as the passive evolution track.

2105.05274,On the influence of halo mass accretion history on galaxy properties and   assembly bias,"Halo assembly bias is the secondary dependence of the clustering of dark-matter haloes on their assembly histories at fixed halo mass. This established dependence is expected to manifest itself on the clustering of the galaxy population, a potential effect commonly known as galaxy assembly bias. Using the IllustrisTNG300 magnetohydrodynamical simulation, we analyse the dependence of the properties and clustering of galaxies on the shape of the specific mass accretion history of their hosting haloes (sMAH). We first show that several halo and galaxy properties strongly correlate with the slope of the sMAH ($\beta$) at fixed halo mass. Namely, haloes with increasingly steeper $\beta$ increment their halo masses faster at early times, and their hosted galaxies present larger stellar-to-halo mass ratios, lose their gas faster, reach the peak of their star formation histories at higher redshift, and become quenched earlier. We also demonstrate that $\beta$ is more directly connected to these key galaxy formation properties than other broadly employed halo proxies, such as formation time. Finally, we measure the secondary dependence of galaxy clustering on $\beta$ at fixed halo mass as a function of redshift. By tracing back the evolution of individual haloes, we show that the amplitude of the galaxy assembly bias signal for the progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies increases with redshift, reaching a factor of 2 at $z = 1$ for haloes of $M_\mathrm{halo}=10^{11.5}-10^{12}$ $h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$.

The volume of 8$\cGpc$, combined with a resolution of about $8\times 10^{10}\Ms$ for the cold dark matter (CDM) component, represents a significant improvement over previous N-body simulations in massive neutrino cosmologies. We show that most of the nonlinear evolution is generated exclusively by the CDM component. We find that accounting only for the nonlinear evolution of the CDM power spectrum allows to recover the total matter power spectrum with the same accuracy as the massless case. Indeed, we show that, the most recent version of the \halofit\ formula calibrated on $\Lambda$CDM simulations can be applied directly to the linear CDM power spectrum without requiring additional fitting parameters in the massive case. As a second step, we study the abundance and clustering properties of CDM halos, confirming that, in massive neutrino cosmologies, the proper definition of the halo bias should be made with respect to the {\em cold} rather than the {\em total} matter distribution, as recently shown in the literature. Here we extend these results to the redshift space, finding that, when accounting for massive neutrinos, an improper definition of the linear bias can lead to a systematic error of about 1-$2 \%$ in the determination of the linear growth rate from anisotropic clustering.

1211.6213,Non-Gaussian error bars in galaxy surveys -- II,"(Abridged) Estimating the uncertainty on the matter power spectrum internally (i.e. directly from the data) is made challenging by the simple fact that galaxy surveys offer at most a few independent samples. In addition, surveys have non-trivial geometries, which make the interpretation of the observations even trickier, but the uncertainty can nevertheless be worked out within the Gaussian approximation. With the recent realization that Gaussian treatments of the power spectrum lead to biased error bars about the dilation of the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale, efforts are being directed towards developing non-Gaussian analyses, mainly from N-body simulations so far. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to tell how the non-Gaussian features observed in the simulations compare to those of the real Universe, and it is generally hard to tell at what level of accuracy the N-body simulations can model complicated non-linear effects such as mode coupling and galaxy bias.

 (Abridged) Estimating the uncertainty on the matter power spectrum internally (i.e. directly from the data) is made challenging by the simple fact that galaxy surveys offer at most a few independent samples. In addition, surveys have non-trivial geometries, which make the interpretation of the observations even trickier, but the uncertainty can nevertheless be worked out within the Gaussian approximation. With the recent realization that Gaussian treatments of the power spectrum lead to biased error bars about the dilation of the baryonic acoustic oscillation scale, efforts are being directed towards developing non-Gaussian analyses, mainly from N-body simulations so far. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to tell how the non-Gaussian features observed in the simulations compare to those of the real Universe, and it is generally hard to tell at what level of accuracy the N-body simulations can model complicated non-linear effects such as mode coupling and galaxy bias. We propose in this paper a novel method that aims at measuring non-Gaussian error bars on the matter power spectrum directly from galaxy survey data. We utilize known symmetries of the 4-point function, Wiener filtering and principal component analysis to estimate the full covariance matrix from only four independent fields with minimal prior assumptions.

While in a cleaned but otherwise untouched 92 GHz map of this cluster, little to no negative signal is visible, careful subtraction of known sub-millimetre emitters in the uv plane reveals a decrement at 5$\sigma$ significance. The total signal is -190$\pm$36 $\mu$Jy, with a peak offset by 5""-9"" ($\sim$50 kpc) from both the X-ray centroid and the still-forming brightest cluster galaxy.

1506.00902,Constraining spatial extent and temperature of dust around galaxies from   far-infrared image stacking analysis,"We propose a novel method to constrain the spatial extent of dust around galaxies through the measurement of dust temperature. Our method combines the dust emission of galaxies from far-infrared (FIR) image stacking analysis and the quasar reddening due to the dust absorption around galaxies. As a specific application of our method, we use the stacked FIR emission profiles of SDSS photometric galaxies over the IRAS 100$\mu$m map, and the recent measurement of the SDSS galaxy-quasar cross-correlation. If we adopt a single-temperature dust model, the resulting temperature is around 18K, which is consistent with a typical dust temperature for a central part of galaxies. If we assume an additional dust component with much lower temperature, the current data imply the temperature of the galactic dust needs to be higher, 20K to 30K. Since the model of the density and temperature distribution of dust adopted in the current paper is very simple, we cannot draw any strong conclusion at this point.

In this paper, we study how to avoid the overproduction of axion dark radiation with some concrete examples. We show that, by taking account of the finite-temperature dissipation effect appropriately, the overproduction constraint can be relaxed since the PQ scalar can take part in the thermal plasma again even after the PQ phase transition.

1211.0684,Giant stellar arcs in the Large Magellanic Cloud: a possible link with   past activity of the Milky Way nucleus,"The origin of the giant stellar arcs in the LMC remains a controversial issue, discussed since 1966. No other stellar arc is so perfect a segment of a circle, moreover, there is another similar arc nearby. Many hypotheses were advanced to explain these arcs, and all but one of these were disproved. It was proposed in 2004 that origin of these arcs was due to the bow shock from the jet, which is intermittently fired by the Milky Way nucleus and during the last episode of its activity the jet was pointed to the LMC. Quite recently evidence for such a jet has really appeared. We suppose it was once energetic enough to trigger star formation in the LMC, and if the jet opening angle was about 2{\deg}, it could push out HI gas from the region of about 2 kpc in size, forming a cavity LMC4, but also squeezed two dense clouds, which occurred in the same area, causing the formation of stars along their surfaces facing the core of the MW. In result, spherical segments of the stellar shells might arise, visible now as the arcs of Quadrant and Sextant, the apices of which point to the center of the MW. This orientation of both arcs can be the key to unlocking their origin.

This contrasts with a bias several times larger for the earlier IA implementation. Therefore there is no doubt that IAs must be taken into account for future Stage III experiments and beyond. We use a flexible grid of IA and galaxy bias parameters as used in previous work, and investigate what would happen if the universe used the latest IA model, but we assumed the earlier version.

In the most general search, pairs of circles with deviation from antipodality $0^\circ \leq \theta \leq 169^\circ$ and radii $10^\circ \leq \lambda \leq 90^\circ$ were investigated, but no matching circles were found. Assuming this negative result, we examine the question as to whether there are nearly flat universes with compact topology that would give rise to circles whose observable parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$ fall o outside the ranges covered by this search. We derive the expressions for the deviation from antipodality and for the radius of the circles associated to a pair elements ($\gamma\,$,$\gamma^{-1}$) of the holonomy group $\Gamma$ which define the spatial section of any positively curved universe with a nontrivial topology. We show that there is a critical position that maximizes the deviation from antipodality, and prove that no matter how nearly flat the Universe is, it can always have a nontrivial spatial topology that gives rise to circles whose deviation from antipodality $\theta$ is larger than $169^\circ$, and whose radii of the circles $\lambda$ are smaller than $10^\circ$ for some observers. This makes apparent that slightly positively curved universes with cosmological parameters within Planck bounds can be endowed with a nontrivial spatial topology with values of the parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$ outside the ranges covered by the searches for circles carried out so far. Thus, these circles searches so far undertaken are not sufficient to exclude the possibility of a universe with a detectable nontrivial cosmic topology.

In the most general search, pairs of circles with deviation from antipodality $0^\circ \leq \theta \leq 169^\circ$ and radii $10^\circ \leq \lambda \leq 90^\circ$ were investigated, but no matching circles were found. Assuming this negative result, we examine the question as to whether there are nearly flat universes with compact topology that would give rise to circles whose observable parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$ fall o outside the ranges covered by this search. We derive the expressions for the deviation from antipodality and for the radius of the circles associated to a pair elements ($\gamma\,$,$\gamma^{-1}$) of the holonomy group $\Gamma$ which define the spatial section of any positively curved universe with a nontrivial topology. We show that there is a critical position that maximizes the deviation from antipodality, and prove that no matter how nearly flat the Universe is, it can always have a nontrivial spatial topology that gives rise to circles whose deviation from antipodality $\theta$ is larger than $169^\circ$, and whose radii of the circles $\lambda$ are smaller than $10^\circ$ for some observers. This makes apparent that slightly positively curved universes with cosmological parameters within Planck bounds can be endowed with a nontrivial spatial topology with values of the parameters $\lambda$ and $\theta$ outside the ranges covered by the searches for circles carried out so far. Thus, these circles searches so far undertaken are not sufficient to exclude the possibility of a universe with a detectable nontrivial cosmic topology. We present concrete examples of such nearly flat universes, and discuss the implications of our results in view of unavoidable practical limits of the circles-in-the-sky method."

Using the [OIII] line we have measured accurate systemic redshifts for these two galaxies, and discovered a velocity offset between the [OIII] and Ly-alpha lines in both, with the Lya line peaking 342 and 125 km/s redward of the systemic velocity. These velocity offsets imply that there are powerful outflows in high-redshift LAEs.

Previous theories require that dwarf spheroidals orbit near giant galaxies like the Milky Way, but some dwarfs have been observed in the outskirts of the Local Group. Here we report simulations of encounters between dwarf disk galaxies and somewhat larger objects. We find that the encounters excite a process, which we term ``resonant stripping'', that can transform them into dwarf spheroidals. This effect is distinct from other mechanisms proposed to form dwarf spheroidals, including mergers, galaxy-galaxy harassment, or tidal and ram pressure stripping, because it is driven by gravitational resonances. It may account for the observed properties of dwarf spheroidals in the Local Group, including their morphologies and kinematics.

The observational sample is volume-limited out to z=0.1 with $M_r -$ 5 log$(h) \le -19.6$. We construct a mock catalogue of galaxies that shows a similar signal of assembly bias (46 $\pm$ 9 per cent) at the same halo mass. We then adapt the model presented by Lacerna & Padilla (Paper I) to redefine the overdensity peak height, which traces the assembly bias such that galaxies in equal density peaks show the same clustering regardless of their stellar age, but this time using observational features such as a flux limit. The proxy for peak height, which is proposed as a better alternative than the virial mass, consists in the total mass given by the mass of neighbour host haloes in cylinders centred at each central galaxy. The radius of the cylinder is parametrized as a function of stellar age and virial mass. The best-fitting set of parameters that make the assembly bias signal lower than 5$-$15 per cent for both SDSS and mock central galaxies are similar. The idea behind the parametrization is not to minimize the bias, but it is to use this method to understand the physical features that produce the assembly bias effect. Even though the tracers of the density field used here differ significantly from those used in paper I, our analysis of the simulated catalogue indicates that the different tracers produce correlated proxies, and therefore the reason behind this assembly bias is the crowding of peaks in both simulations and the SDSS.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"The nature of assembly bias - III.

1006.2136,Host galaxies of luminous quasars: population synthesis of optical   off-axis spectra,"There is increasing evidence of a connection between AGN activity and galaxy evolution. To obtain further insight into this potentially important evolutionary phase, we analyse the properties of quasar host galaxies. In this paper, we present a population synthesis modeling technique for off-axis spectra, the results of which constrain host colour and the stellar ages of luminous quasars (M_V(nuc)<-23). Our technique is similar to well established quiescent-galaxy models, modified to accommodate scattered nuclear light (a combination of atmospheric, instrumental and host galaxy scattered light) observed off axis. In our model, subtraction of residual scattered quasar light is performed, while simultaneously modeling the constituent stellar populations of the host galaxy. The reliability of this technique is tested via a Monte-Carlo routine in which the correspondence between synthetic spectra with known parameters and the model output is determined. Application of this model to a preliminary sample of 10 objects is presented and compared to previous studies. Spectroscopic data was obtained via long-slit and integral-field unit observations on the Keck and WIYN telescopes. We confirm that elliptical quasar hosts are distinguishable (bluer) from inactive ellipticals in rest frame B-V colour. Additionally, we note a trend for radio luminous (L_5GHz > 10^40 erg s^-1) quasars to be located in redder host galaxies in comparison to their less luminous radio counterparts. While the host colour and age of our radio luminous sample is in close proximity to the green valley, our radio faint sample is consistent with quiescent star-forming galaxies.

This fact translates into wider regions of applicability of the relaxation mechanism when compared to the Standard Model Higgs case. Our results show that, if the electroweak scale is not fundamental but radiatively generated, it is possible to generate the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry via the relaxation mechanism."

Using one-zone models of cosmic ray (CR) injection, cooling, and escape in star-forming galaxies, we attempt to reproduce the observed FIR-radio correlation over its entire span. We show that ~2% of the kinetic energy from supernova explosions must go into primary CR electrons and that ~10 - 20% must go into primary CR protons. Secondary electrons and positrons are likely comparable to or dominate primary electrons in dense starburst galaxies. We discuss the implications of our models for the magnetic field strengths of starbursts, the detectability of starbursts by Fermi, and cosmic ray feedback. Overall, our models indicate that both CR protons and electrons escape from low surface density galaxies, but lose most of their energy before escaping dense starbursts. The FIR-radio correlation is caused by a combination of the efficient cooling of CR electrons (calorimetry) in starbursts and a conspiracy of several factors. For lower surface density galaxies, the decreasing radio emission caused by CR escape is balanced by the decreasing FIR emission caused by the low effective UV dust opacity. In starbursts, bremsstrahlung, ionization, and Inverse Compton cooling decrease the radio emission, but they are countered by secondary electrons/positrons and the decreasing critical synchrotron frequency, which both increase the radio emission.

After this second generation of star formation, type II SNe from the second generation and then prompt type Ia SNe associated with the first generation maintain a gas-free GC, thereby ending the cycle of star formation events. Our model makes clear predictions for the presence or absence of multiple stellar populations within GCs as a function of GC mass and formation environment.

The main aim of this analysis is to understand how the implementation of baryonic physics in simulations affects such relation, i.e. to what extent the use of the velocity dispersion as a proxy for cluster mass determination is hampered by the imperfect knowledge of the baryonic physics. In our analysis we use several sets of simulations with different physics implemented. Velocity dispersions are determined using three different tracers, DM particles, subhalos, and galaxies.   We confirm that DM particles trace a relation that is fully consistent with the theoretical expectations based on the virial theorem and with previous results presented in the literature. On the other hand, subhalos and galaxies trace steeper relations, and with larger values of the normalization. Such relations imply that galaxies and subhalos have a $\sim10$ per cent velocity bias relative to the DM particles, which can be either positive or negative, depending on halo mass, redshift and physics implemented in the simulation.   We explain these differences as due to dynamical processes, namely dynamical friction and tidal disruption, acting on substructures and galaxies, but not on DM particles. These processes appear to be more or less effective, depending on the halo masses and the importance of baryon cooling, and may create a non-trivial dependence of the velocity bias and the $\soneD$--$\Mtwo$ relation on the tracer, the halo mass and its redshift.

We constrain the fraction of 1998bw-like broad-lined Type Ic supernovae to be <~ 41% (99.865% confidence). Most of the events in our sample also exclude off-axis jets similar to GRB 031203 and GRB 030329, but we cannot rule out off-axis gamma-ray-bursts expanding in a low-density wind environment. Three supernovae in our sample are detected in the radio. PTF11qcj and PTF14dby show late-time radio emission with average ejecta speeds of ~(0.3-0.4)c, on the dividing line between relativistic and ""ordinary"" supernovae. The speed of PTF11cmh radio ejecta is poorly constrained. We estimate that <~ 85% (99.865% confidence) of the broad-lined Type Ic supernovae in our sample may harbor off-axis $\gamma$-ray-bursts expanding in media with densities in the range probed by this study."
1205.4242,Physical properties of dense molecular gas in centres of Seyfert   galaxies,"We present new ~1"" resolution data of the dense molecular gas in the central 50-100 pc of four nearby Seyfert galaxies. PdBI observations of HCN and, in 2 of the 4 sources, simultaneously HCO+ allow us to carefully constrain the dynamical state of the dense gas surrounding the AGN. Analysis of the kinematics shows large line widths of 100-200 km/s FWHM that can only partially arise from beam smearing of the velocity gradient. The observed morphological and kinematic parameters (dimensions, major axis position angle, red and blue channel separation, and integrated line width) are well reproduced by a thick disk, where the emitting dense gas has a large intrinsic dispersion (20-40 km/s), implying that it exists at significant scale heights (25-30% of the disk radius). To put the observed kinematics in the context of the starburst and AGN evolution, we estimate the Toomre Q parameter. We find this is always greater than the critical value, i.e. Q is above the limit such that the gas is stable against rapid star formation. This is supported by the lack of direct evidence, in these 4 Seyfert galaxies, for on-going star formation close around the AGN. Instead, any current star formation tends to be located in a circumnuclear ring.

2210.16341,Potential scientific synergies in weak lensing studies between the CSST   and Euclid space probes,"Aims. With the next generation of large surveys coming to the stage of observational cosmology soon, it is important to explore their potential synergies and to maximise their scientific outcomes. In this study, we aim to investigate the complementarity of the two upcoming space missions Euclid and the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), focusing on weak lensing (WL) cosmology. In particular, we analyse the photometric redshifts (photo-zs) and the galaxy blending effects. For Euclid, WL measurements suffer from chromatic PSF effects. For this, CSST can provide valuable information for Euclid to obtain more accurate PSF, and to calibrate the color and color-gradient biases for WL measurements.   Methods. We create image simulations for different surveys, and quantify the photo-z performance. For blending analyses, we employ high-resolution HST/CANDELS data to mock Euclid, CSST, and an LSST-like survey. We analyse the blending fraction for different cases, and the blending effects on galaxy photometry. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CSST can provide a large enough number of high SNR multi-band galaxy images to calibrate the color-gradient biases for Euclid.   Results. The sky coverage of Euclid lies entirely within the CSST footprint. The combination of Euclid with CSST data can be done more uniformly than with the various ground-based data. Our studies show that by combining Euclid and CSST, we can reach a photo-z precision of $\sigma_{\rm NMAD} \approx 0.04$, and an outlier fraction of $\eta\approx 2.4\%$. Because of the similarly high resolutions, the data combination of Euclid and CSST can be relatively straightforward for photometry. To include ground-based data, however, sophisticated deblending utilizing priors from high-resolution space data is demanded.

The good S/N permits stacking analyses for subgroups. We observe a trend of star formation rate increasing with redshift. An increase of star formation rate with AGN luminosity is indicated at the highest L_2-10>~1E44erg/s luminosities only. Increasing trends with X-ray obscuration as expected in some AGN evolutionary scenarios are not observed for the bulk of the X-ray AGN sample but may be present for the highest intrinsic luminosity objects.

For the bulk of the sample, the X-ray luminosity and obscuration of the AGN are not intimately linked to the global star formation rate of their hosts. The hosts are likely massive and forming stars secularly, at rates similar to the pervasive star formation seen in massive galaxies without an AGN at similar redshifts. The change indicated towards more intense star formation, and a more pronounced increase in star formation rates between unobscured and obscured AGN at highest luminosities suggests that luminous AGN follow an evolutionary path on which obscured AGN activity and intense star formation are linked, possibly via merging.

1203.5551,The Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function at the Dawn of Gaia,"The [O III] 5007 Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function (PNLF) is an excellent extragalactic standard candle. In theory, the PNLF method should not work at all, since the luminosities of the brightest planetary nebulae (PNe) should be highly sensitive to the age of their host stellar population. Yet the method appears robust, as it consistently produces < 10% distances to galaxies of all Hubble types, from the earliest ellipticals to the latest-type spirals and irregulars. It is therefore uniquely suited for cross-checking the results of other techniques and finding small offsets between the Population I and Population II distance ladders. We review the calibration of the method and show that the zero points provided by Cepheids and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch are in excellent agreement. We then compare the results of the PNLF with those from Surface Brightness Fluctuation measurements, and show that, although both techniques agree in a relative sense, the latter method yields distances that are ~15% larger than those from the PNLF. We trace this discrepancy back to the calibration galaxies and argue that, due to a small systematic error associated with internal reddening, the true distance scale likely falls between the extremes of the two methods. We also demonstrate how PNLF measurements in the early-type galaxies that have hosted Type Ia supernovae can help calibrate the SN Ia maximum magnitude-rate of decline relation.

0903.1106,Reconstruction of the Primordial Power Spectrum using Temperature and   Polarisation Data from Multiple Experiments,"We develop a method to reconstruct the primordial power spectrum, P(k), using both temperature and polarisation data from the joint analysis of a number of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The method is an extension of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, first applied in this context by Shafieloo & Souradeep. We show how the inclusion of polarisation measurements can decrease the uncertainty in the reconstructed power spectrum. In particular, the polarisation data can constrain oscillations in the spectrum more effectively than total intensity only measurements. We apply the estimator to a compilation of current CMB results.

 We develop a method to reconstruct the primordial power spectrum, P(k), using both temperature and polarisation data from the joint analysis of a number of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The method is an extension of the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, first applied in this context by Shafieloo & Souradeep. We show how the inclusion of polarisation measurements can decrease the uncertainty in the reconstructed power spectrum. In particular, the polarisation data can constrain oscillations in the spectrum more effectively than total intensity only measurements. We apply the estimator to a compilation of current CMB results.

Whenever correlation functions are used for inference about cosmological parameters in the context of a Bayesian analysis, the likelihood function of correlation functions needs to be known.

We show how to calculate a better approximation for the probability distribution of correlation functions, which we call ""quasi-Gaussian"".   Methods. Using the exact univariate PDF as well as constraints on correlation functions previously derived, we transform the correlation functions to an unconstrained variable for which the Gaussian approximation is well justified. From this Gaussian in the transformed space, we obtain the quasi-Gaussian PDF. The two approximations for the probability distributions are compared to the ""true"" distribution as obtained from simulations. Additionally, we test how the new approximation performs when used as likelihood in a toy-model Bayesian analysis.   Results.

This allows us to construct the most robust circular polarization (CP) spectrum of an AGN jet to date. We find m_c \propto \nu^{+0.60\pm0.03} from 1.5 to 6.5 GHz, with a peak of m_c ~ 1% before the spectrum turns over somewhere between 6.5 and 8 GHz, above which m_c \propto \nu^{-3.0\pm0.4}.

The other three groups show a significant detection (up to $5 \sigma$ in mass), with velocity dispersions between $355^{+55}_{-70}$ and $530^{+45}_{-55}$ km s$^{-1}$ and masses between $0.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{14}$ and $1.6^{+0.5}_{-0.4}\times 10^{14} h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, consistent with independent measurements. These groups are associated with peaks in the galaxy and gas density in a relatively straightforward manner. Since the groups show no visible signs of interaction, this supports the picture that we are catching the groups before they merge into a cluster."

We also note that while XENON100's two nuclear recoil candidates each exhibit very low ratios of ionization-to-scintillation signals, making them difficult to attribute to known electronic or neutron backgrounds, they are consistent with originating from dark matter particles in the mass range favored by CoGeNT and CDMS.

1704.04075,Changing the prior: absolute neutrino mass constraints in nonlocal   gravity,"Prior change is discussed in observational constraints studies of nonlocally modified gravity. In the latter, a model characterized by a modification of the form $\sim m^2 R\Box^{-2}R$ to the Einstein-Hilbert action was compared against the base $\Lambda$CDM one in a Bayesian way. It was found that the competing modified gravity model is significantly disfavored (at $22 \,$:$\, 1$ in terms of betting-odds) against $\Lambda$CDM given CMB+SNIa+BAO data, because of a dominant tension appearing in the $H_0 \,$-$\, \Omega_M$ plan.

2010.05289,Investigating Dark Energy Equation of State With High Redshift Hubble   Diagram,"Several independent cosmological data, collected within the last twenty years, revealed the accelerated expansion rate of the Universe, usually assumed to be driven by the so called dark energy, which, according to recent estimates, provides now about 70 % of the total amount of matter-energy in the Universe. The nature of dark energy is yet unknown. Several models of dark energy have been proposed: a non zero cosmological constant, a potential energy of some self interacting scalar field, effects related to the non homogeneous distribution of matter, or effects due to alternative theories of gravity. Recently, it turned out that the standard flat LambdaCDM is disfavored (at 4 sigma) when confronted with a high redshift Hubble diagram, consisting of supernovae of type Ia (SNIa), quasars (QSOs) and gamma ray-bursts (GRBs) ([1-3]). Here we use the same data to investigate if this tension is confirmed, using a different approach: actually in [1-3], the deviation between the best fit model and the LambdaCDM model was noticed by comparing cosmological parameters derived from cosmographic expansions of their theoretical predictions and observed high redshift Hubble diagram. In this paper we use a substantially different approach, based on a specific parametrization of the redshift dependent equation of state (EOS) of dark energy component w(z).

 Several independent cosmological data, collected within the last twenty years, revealed the accelerated expansion rate of the Universe, usually assumed to be driven by the so called dark energy, which, according to recent estimates, provides now about 70 % of the total amount of matter-energy in the Universe. The nature of dark energy is yet unknown. Several models of dark energy have been proposed: a non zero cosmological constant, a potential energy of some self interacting scalar field, effects related to the non homogeneous distribution of matter, or effects due to alternative theories of gravity. Recently, it turned out that the standard flat LambdaCDM is disfavored (at 4 sigma) when confronted with a high redshift Hubble diagram, consisting of supernovae of type Ia (SNIa), quasars (QSOs) and gamma ray-bursts (GRBs) ([1-3]). Here we use the same data to investigate if this tension is confirmed, using a different approach: actually in [1-3], the deviation between the best fit model and the LambdaCDM model was noticed by comparing cosmological parameters derived from cosmographic expansions of their theoretical predictions and observed high redshift Hubble diagram. In this paper we use a substantially different approach, based on a specific parametrization of the redshift dependent equation of state (EOS) of dark energy component w(z). Our statistical analysis is aimed to estimate the parameters characterizing the dark energy EOS: our results indicate (at > 3 sigma level) an evolving dark energy EOS, while the cosmological constant has a constant EOS, wLambda =-1. This result not only confirms the tension previously detected, but shows that it is not an artifact of cosmographic expansions."

The combination of these data and earlier 1.7-GHz observations allows the study of the spectral index distribution across the source structure and the unambiguous determination of the nature of each component. In seven sources we detected the core component with a flat or inverted spectrum. In six sources the radio emission has a two-sided morphology and comes mainly from steep-spectrum extended structures, like lobes, jets, and hotspots. Only one source, 0319+121, has a one-sided core-jet structure. In three out of the six sources with a two-sided structure the flux density arising from the lobes is asymmetric, and the brightest lobe is the one closest to the core, suggesting that the jets are expanding in an inhomogeneous ambient medium which may influence the source growth. The interaction between the jet and the environment may slow down the source expansion and enhance the luminosity due to severe radiative losses, likely producing an excess of CSS radio sources in flux density limited samples. The lobes of the other three asymmetric sources have a brighter-when-farther behaviour, in agreement with what is expected by projection and relativistic effects.

In this work, we derive a formula for the squeezed bispectrum including the explicit correction to the consistency relation, as a proof of its violation in the non-attractor cases.

1107.0775,Radio Supernovae in the Great Survey Era,"Radio properties of supernova outbursts remain poorly understood despite longstanding campaigns following events discovered at other wavelengths. After ~ 30 years of observations, only ~ 50 supernovae have been detected at radio wavelengths, none of which are Type Ia. Even the most radio-loud events are ~ 10^4 fainter in the radio than in the optical; to date, such intrinsically dim objects have only been visible in the very local universe. The detection and study of radio supernovae (RSNe) will be fundamentally altered and dramatically improved as the next generation of radio telescopes comes online, including EVLA, ASKAP, and MeerKAT, and culminating in the Square Kilometer Array (SKA); the latter should be > 50 times more sensitive than present facilities. SKA can repeatedly scan large (> 1 deg^2) areas of the sky, and thus will discover RSNe and other transient sources in a new, automatic, untargeted, and unbiased way. We estimate SKA will be able to detect core-collapse RSNe out to redshift z ~ 5, with an all-redshift rate ~ 620 events yr^-1 deg^-2, assuming a survey sensitivity of 50 nJy and radio lightcurves like those of SN 1993J. Hence SKA should provide a complete core-collapse RSN sample that is sufficient for statistical studies of radio properties of core-collapse supernovae. EVLA should find ~ 160 events yr^-1 deg^-2 out to redshift z ~ 3, and other SKA precursors should have similar detection rates.

 Radio properties of supernova outbursts remain poorly understood despite longstanding campaigns following events discovered at other wavelengths. After ~ 30 years of observations, only ~ 50 supernovae have been detected at radio wavelengths, none of which are Type Ia. Even the most radio-loud events are ~ 10^4 fainter in the radio than in the optical; to date, such intrinsically dim objects have only been visible in the very local universe. The detection and study of radio supernovae (RSNe) will be fundamentally altered and dramatically improved as the next generation of radio telescopes comes online, including EVLA, ASKAP, and MeerKAT, and culminating in the Square Kilometer Array (SKA); the latter should be > 50 times more sensitive than present facilities. SKA can repeatedly scan large (> 1 deg^2) areas of the sky, and thus will discover RSNe and other transient sources in a new, automatic, untargeted, and unbiased way. We estimate SKA will be able to detect core-collapse RSNe out to redshift z ~ 5, with an all-redshift rate ~ 620 events yr^-1 deg^-2, assuming a survey sensitivity of 50 nJy and radio lightcurves like those of SN 1993J. Hence SKA should provide a complete core-collapse RSN sample that is sufficient for statistical studies of radio properties of core-collapse supernovae. EVLA should find ~ 160 events yr^-1 deg^-2 out to redshift z ~ 3, and other SKA precursors should have similar detection rates.

1501.06918,Cosmological scalar field perturbations can grow,"It has been argued that the small perturbations to the homogeneous and isotropic configurations of a canonical scalar field in an expanding universe do not grow. We show that this is not true in general, and clarify the root of the misunderstanding.

Under this assumption the linear perturbations grow like those in the standard cold dark matter scenario, but with a Jeans length at the scale of the Compton wavelength of the scalar particle. Contrary to previous analyses in the literature our results do not rely on time-averages and/or fluid identifications, and instead we solve both analytically (in terms of a well-defined series expansion) and numerically the linearized Einstein-Klein-Gordon system. Also, we use gauge-invariant fields, which makes the physical analysis more transparent and simplifies the comparison with previous works carried out in different gauges.

2204.02984,"Determining the Hubble Constant without the Sound Horizon: A $3.6\%$   Constraint on $H_0$ from Galaxy Surveys, CMB Lensing and Supernovae","Many theoretical resolutions to the so-called ""Hubble tension"" rely on modifying the sound horizon at recombination, $r_s$, and thus the acoustic scale used as a standard ruler in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large scale structure (LSS) datasets. As shown in a number of recent works, these observables can also be used to compute $r_s$-independent constraints on $H_0$ by making use of the horizon scale at matter-radiation equality, $k_{\rm eq}$, which has different sensitivity to high redshift physics than $r_s$. As such, $r_s$- and $k_{\rm eq}$-based measurements of $H_0$ (within a $\Lambda$CDM framework) may differ if there is new physics present pre-recombination. In this work, we present the tightest constraints on the latter from current data, finding $H_0=64.8^{+2.2}_{-2.5}$ at 68% CL (in $\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ units) from a combination of BOSS galaxy power spectra, Planck CMB lensing, and the newly released Pantheon+ supernova constraints, as well as physical priors on the baryon density, neutrino mass, and spectral index. The BOSS and Planck measurements have different degeneracy directions, leading to the improved combined constraints, with a bound of $H_0 = 67.1^{+2.5}_{-2.9}$ ($63.6^{+2.9}_{-3.6}$) from BOSS (Planck) alone. The results show some dependence on the neutrino mass bounds, with the constraint broadening to $H_0 = 68.0^{+2.9}_{-3.2}$ if we instead impose a weak prior on $\sum m_\nu$ from terrestrial experiments, or shifting to $H_0 = 64.6\pm2.4$ if the neutrino mass is fixed to its minimal value.

As shown in a number of recent works, these observables can also be used to compute $r_s$-independent constraints on $H_0$ by making use of the horizon scale at matter-radiation equality, $k_{\rm eq}$, which has different sensitivity to high redshift physics than $r_s$. As such, $r_s$- and $k_{\rm eq}$-based measurements of $H_0$ (within a $\Lambda$CDM framework) may differ if there is new physics present pre-recombination. In this work, we present the tightest constraints on the latter from current data, finding $H_0=64.8^{+2.2}_{-2.5}$ at 68% CL (in $\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ units) from a combination of BOSS galaxy power spectra, Planck CMB lensing, and the newly released Pantheon+ supernova constraints, as well as physical priors on the baryon density, neutrino mass, and spectral index. The BOSS and Planck measurements have different degeneracy directions, leading to the improved combined constraints, with a bound of $H_0 = 67.1^{+2.5}_{-2.9}$ ($63.6^{+2.9}_{-3.6}$) from BOSS (Planck) alone. The results show some dependence on the neutrino mass bounds, with the constraint broadening to $H_0 = 68.0^{+2.9}_{-3.2}$ if we instead impose a weak prior on $\sum m_\nu$ from terrestrial experiments, or shifting to $H_0 = 64.6\pm2.4$ if the neutrino mass is fixed to its minimal value. Even without dependence on the sound horizon, our results are in $\approx 3\sigma$ tension with those obtained from the Cepheid-calibrated distance ladder, which begins to cause problems for new physics models that vary $H_0$ by changing acoustic physics or the expansion history immediately prior to recombination."

Thus, high spatial resolution multiwavelength studies of nearby Lya emitters, like Haro 2, are highly needed. For that purpose, we have used Chandra X-ray and HST (UV, optical and NIR) images of Haro 2, and STIS and ground-based spectral images along its major and minor axes, to characterize the Lya emission and the properties of the stellar population. The UV, Ha (Halpha) and FIR luminosities of the Haro 2 nuclear starburst are reproduced using evolutionary synthesis models assuming a young stellar population with ages ~3.5-5.0 Myr, affected by differential interstellar extinctions. The observed X-ray emission is attributed to gas heated by the mechanical energy released by the starburst (soft component) and a Ultra-Luminous X-ray source candidate (hard). Both compact and diffuse Lya components are observed. Whereas Lya is spatially decoupled from Balmer lines emission, Balmer decrement and UV continuum, the diffuse Lya component is spatially correlated with the diffuse soft X-ray emission. Moreover, unlike the compact one, diffuse Lya shows luminosities larger than predicted from Ha, assuming case B recombination and dust extinction as derived from Ha/Hbeta. We propose that, whereas the compact Lya emission is associated to the massive stellar clusters and is affected by outflows and dust extinction, the diffuse Lya originates in gas ionized by the hot plasma responsible for the soft X-ray radiation, as suggested by their spatial correlation and by the measured L(Ha)/LsoftX ratios.

The central idea of these tests is to determine the average ellipticity of all galaxies with shape measurements in a grid in the pixel plane. The distribution of the absolute values of these averaged ellipticities can be compared to randomized catalogues; a difference points to systematics in the data. In addition, we introduce a method to quantify the spatial correlation of the additive bias, which suppresses the contribution from cosmic shear and therefore eases the identification of a position-dependent additive shear bias in the data. We apply these tests to the publicly available shear catalogues from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) and the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) and find evidence for a small but non-negligible residual additive bias at small scales. As this residual bias is smaller than the error on the shear correlation signal at those scales, it is highly unlikely that it causes a significant bias in the published cosmic shear results of CFHTLenS.

The equations of motion namely, the Friedmann equation, the Raychadhuri equation and the Klein-Gordon equation for an expanding background are extracted from the gravitational action utilizing the variational principle. The consequential system of differential equations with respect to Hubble's parameter and the inflaton field was quite perplexed in order to be solved with an analytic way. Therefore, the slow-roll conditions during inflationary era were imposed and terms with minor numerically contribution were neglected. From the overall phenomenological analysis it is proved that, models with exotic kinetic terms can generate viable results in consistency with the latest Planck data.

Our approach about the inflationary era is that it can be described in the context of Einstein's gravity involving quantum corrections such as the Chern-Simons string inspired parity violating gravitational term. The equations of motion namely, the Friedmann equation, the Raychadhuri equation and the Klein-Gordon equation for an expanding background are extracted from the gravitational action utilizing the variational principle. The consequential system of differential equations with respect to Hubble's parameter and the inflaton field was quite perplexed in order to be solved with an analytic way. Therefore, the slow-roll conditions during inflationary era were imposed and terms with minor numerically contribution were neglected. From the overall phenomenological analysis it is proved that, models with exotic kinetic terms can generate viable results in consistency with the latest Planck data. Finally, the presence of Chern-Simons quantum corrections shifts the primordial spectral tensor index to blue. Even though blue gravitational waves have yet to be observed, if detected, compatibility with the aforementioned theory can be achieved."

To this end, we have generated over 16,000 synthetic images of TNG50 galaxies designed to match KiDS observations, including the effects of dust attenuation and scattering, and used the $\mathrm{\mathtt{statmorph}}$ code to measure various image-based morphological diagnostics in the $r$-band for both data sets.

Overall, we find good agreement between the optical morphologies of TNG50 and KiDS galaxies, although the former are slightly more concentrated and asymmetric than their observational counterparts. Afterwards, we trained a random forest classifier to identify merging galaxies in the simulation (including major and minor mergers) using the morphological diagnostics as the model features, along with merger statistics from the merger trees as the ground truth. We find that the asymmetry statistic exhibits the highest feature importance of all the morphological parameters considered. Thus, the performance of our algorithm is comparable to that of the more traditional method of selecting highly asymmetric galaxies.

We use constrained simulations designed to reproduce the main dynamical features that characterize the local neighborhood, i.e. within tens of Mpc around the Local Group (LG).

By running two simulations of this LG from identical initial conditions - one with and one without baryons modeled hydrodynamically - we can quantify the effect of gas physics on the $z=0$ population of subhaloes in an environment similar to our own. We find that above a certain mass cut, $M_{\rm sub} > 2\times10^{8}h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ subhaloes in hydrodynamic simulations are more radially concentrated than those in simulations with out gas. This is caused by the collapse of baryons into stars that typically sit in the central regions of subhaloes, making them denser. The increased central density of such a subhalo, results in less mass loss due to tidal stripping than the same subhalo simulated with only dark matter. The increased mass in hydrodynamic subhaloes with respect to dark matter ones, causes dynamical friction to be more effective, dragging the subhalo towards the centre of the host.

We follow the dynamical evolution of the density field inside these initially spherical LVs from $z=10$ up to $z_{\rm low} = 0.05$, witnessing highly non-linear, anisotropic mass rearrangements within them, leading to the emergence of the local cosmic web (CW). These mass arrangements have been analysed in terms of the reduced inertia tensor $I_{ij}^r$, focusing on the evolution of the principal axes of inertia and their corresponding eigendirections, and paying particular attention to the times when the evolution of these two structural elements declines.

We have found that deformations are led by dark matter dynamics and they transform most of the initially spherical LVs into prolate shapes, i.e. filamentary structures. An analysis of the individual freezing-out time distributions for shapes and eigendirections shows that first most of the LVs fix their three axes of symmetry (like a skeleton) early on, while accretion flows towards them still continue.

The clusters were divided into subsamples based on their X-ray morphology or whether they host strong cool cores. We find that when the core regions are excluded, the most relaxed clusters (or those with the strongest cool cores) follow an LT relation with a slope that agrees well with simple self-similar expectations. This is supported by an analysis of the gas density profiles of the systems, which shows self-similar behaviour of the gas profiles of the relaxed clusters outside the core regions. By comparing our data with clusters in the REXCESS sample, which extends to lower masses, we find evidence that the self-similar behaviour of even the most relaxed clusters breaks at around 3.5keV. By contrast, the LT slopes of the subsamples of unrelaxed systems (or those without strong cool cores) are significantly steeper than the self-similar model, with lower mass systems appearing less luminous and higher mass systems appearing more luminous than the self-similar relation. We argue that these results are consistent with a model of non-gravitational energy input in clusters that combines central heating with entropy enhancements from merger shocks. Such enhancements could extend the impact of central energy input to larger radii in unrelaxed clusters, as suggested by our data. We also examine the evolution of the LT relation, and find that while the data appear inconsistent with simple self-similar evolution, the differences can be plausibly explained by selection bias, and thus we find no reason to rule out self-similar evolution.

1903.04324,Populations behind the source-subtracted cosmic infrared background   anisotropies,"While the upcoming telescopes will reveal correspondingly fainter, more distant galaxies, a question will persist: what more is there that these telescopes cannot see? One answer is the source-subtracted Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB). The CIB is comprised of the collective light from all sources remaining after known, resolved sources are accounted for. Ever-more-sensitive surveys will identify the brightest of these, allowing them to be removed, and - like peeling layers off an onion - reveal deeper layers of the CIB. In this way it is possible to measure the contributions from populations not accessible to direct telescopic observation. Measurement of fluctuations in the source-subtracted CIB, i.e., the spatial power spectrum of the CIB after subtracting resolved sources, provides a robust means of characterizing its faint, and potentially new, populations. Studies over the past 15 years have revealed source-subtracted CIB fluctuations on scales out to ~100' which cannot be explained by extrapolating from known galaxy populations. Moreover, they appear highly coherent with the unresolved Cosmic X-ray Background, hinting at a significant population of accreting black holes among the CIB sources. Characterizing the source-subtracted CIB with high accuracy, and thereby constraining the nature of the new populations, is feasible with upcoming instruments and would produce critically important cosmological information in the next decade. New coextensive deep and wide-area near-infrared, X-ray, and microwave surveys will bring decisive opportunities to examine, with high fidelity, the spatial spectrum and origin of the CIB fluctuations and their cross-correlations with cosmic microwave and X-ray backgrounds, and determine the formation epochs and the nature of the new sources (stellar nucleosynthetic or accreting black holes).",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Populations behind the source-subtracted cosmic infrared background   anisotropies

This procedure takes advantage of the fact that in the absence of systematic effects, measurements on redundant baselines should exactly match each other. For a given systematic error model, measuring each baseline independently therefore allows to write a system of nonlinear equations whose unknowns are the systematic error model parameters (gains and couplings of Jones matrices for instance). Results. We give the mathematical basis of the self-calibration. We implement this method numerically in the context of bolometric interferometry.

We test the impact of the assumption about the expansion history of the universe ($0.01<z<2.3$) on the local distance ladder estimate of $H_0$. In the fiducial analysis, the Hubble flow Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) sample is truncated to $z < 0.15$ and the deceleration parameter ($q_0$) fixed to -0.55. We create realistic simulations of the calibrator and Pantheon samples and account for a full systematics covariance between these two sets. We fit several physically motivated dark energy models and derive combined constraints from calibrator and Pantheon SNe~Ia and simultaneously infer $H_0$ and dark energy properties.

0908.4023,The large-scale environment of low surface brightness galaxies,"The exact formation scenarios and evolutionary processes that led to the existence of the class of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) have not yet been understood completely. Since the environment of LSBs has been studied before only on small scales (below 2 Mpc), a study of the galaxy content in the vicinity of LSB galaxies on larger scales could add a lot to our understanding of the origin of this galaxy class. We used the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the SDSS DR4 to investigate the environmental galaxy density of LSB galaxies compared to the galaxy density in the vicinity of high surface brightness galaxies (HSBs). The environment studies, divided into two redshift bins, show that both the low mass, and the more massive LSBs possess an environment with a lower galaxy density than HSBs. The differences in the galaxy density between LSBs and HSBs are significant on scales between 2 and 5 Mpc, the scales of groups and filaments. To quantify this, we have introduced for the first time the LSB-HSB Antibias. The obtained LSB-HSB Antibias parameter has a value of 10%-15%. From these results we conclude that LSBs formed in low-density regions of the initial universe and have drifted until now to the outer parts of the filaments and walls of the large-scale structure.

Since the environment of LSBs has been studied before only on small scales (below 2 Mpc), a study of the galaxy content in the vicinity of LSB galaxies on larger scales could add a lot to our understanding of the origin of this galaxy class. We used the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the SDSS DR4 to investigate the environmental galaxy density of LSB galaxies compared to the galaxy density in the vicinity of high surface brightness galaxies (HSBs). The environment studies, divided into two redshift bins, show that both the low mass, and the more massive LSBs possess an environment with a lower galaxy density than HSBs. The differences in the galaxy density between LSBs and HSBs are significant on scales between 2 and 5 Mpc, the scales of groups and filaments. To quantify this, we have introduced for the first time the LSB-HSB Antibias. The obtained LSB-HSB Antibias parameter has a value of 10%-15%. From these results we conclude that LSBs formed in low-density regions of the initial universe and have drifted until now to the outer parts of the filaments and walls of the large-scale structure. Furthermore, our results, together with actual cosmological simulations, show that LSBs are caused by a mixture of nature and nurture."

Not only its instrument suite will open up a discovery window but they will also allow to physically understand some of the phenomena that we still do not understand in the high-redshift universe. Using new homogeneous luminosity functions (LFs) in the Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) from VVDS and in the Far-Infrared (FIR) from Herschel/PEP and Herschel/HerMES, we studied the evolution of the dust attenuation with redshift. With this information, we are able to estimate the redshift evolution of the total (FUV + FIR) star formation rate density (SFRD_TOT). Our main conclusions are that: 1) the dust attenuation A_FUV is found to increase from z = 0 to $z \sim 1.2 and then starts to decrease until our last data point at z = 3.6; 2) the estimated SFRD confirms published results to z \sim 2. At z > 2, we observe either a plateau or a small increase up to z \sim 3 and then a likely decrease up to z = 3.6; 3) the peak of A_FUV is delayed with respect to the plateau of SFRD_TOT but the origin of this delay is not understood yet, and SPICA instruments will provide clues to move further in the physical understanding of this delay but also on the detection and redshift measurements of galaxies at higher redshifts.

1402.3700,Revealing the location and structure of the accretion disk-wind in   PDS456,"We present evidence for the rapid variability of the high velocity iron K-shell absorption in the nearby ($z=0.184$) quasar PDS456. From a recent long Suzaku observation in 2013 ($\sim1$Ms effective duration) we find that the the equivalent width of iron K absorption increases by a factor of $\sim5$ during the observation, increasing from $<105$eV within the first 100ks of the observation, towards a maximum depth of $\sim500$eV near the end. The implied outflow velocity of $\sim0.25$c is consistent with that claimed from earlier (2007, 2011) Suzaku observations. The absorption varies on time-scales as short as $\sim1$ week. We show that this variability can be equally well attributed to either (i) an increase in column density, plausibly associated with a clumpy time-variable outflow, or (ii) the decreasing ionization of a smooth homogeneous outflow which is in photo-ionization equilibrium with the local photon field. The variability allows a direct measure of absorber location, which is constrained to within $r=200-3500$$\rm{r_{g}}$ of the black hole.

We perform full spectral energy distribution (SED) fits over the wavelength range lambda_rest ~0.1-400mu for those objects with good Herschel detections. These fits reveal the need for an additional far-infrared (FIR) component besides the emission from a dusty AGN-powered torus. This additional FIR component has temperatures of T_FIR ~ 40-60K with luminosities of L_(8-1000mu) ~ 10^13 L_sun (accounting for 25-60% of the bolometric FIR luminosity). If the FIR dust emission is due to star formation it would suggest star formation rates in excess of 1000 solar masses per year. We show that at long wavelengths (lambda_rest > 50mu) the contribution of the AGN-powered torus emission is negligible. This explains how previous FIR studies of high-redshift quasars that relied on single component fits to (ground-based) observations at lambda_obs > 350mu reached T_FIR and L_FIR values similar to our complete SED fits. Stacking the Herschel data of four individually undetected sources reveals a significant average signal in the PACS bands but not in SPIRE. The average SED of sources with individual Herschel detections shows a striking surplus in near- and mid-infrared emission when compared to common AGN templates. The comparison between two average SEDs (sources with and without individual Herschel detections) matched in the UV/optical indicates that for these objects the strength of the MIR emission may correlate with the strength of the FIR emission.,astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Complete infrared spectral energy distributions of mm detected quasars   at z>5

The bound monopole ground state, which in vacuum is stable and has no magnetic charge or moment, is shown to become quantum mechanically unstable in the presence of an external, ordinary magnetic field. If these states contribute sizably to the local dark matter density, they can extract significant energy from the galactic magnetic field if their decay occurs on a galactic timescale or less. We revise and extend this ""Parker Bound"" on galactic magnetic energy loss to milli-monopoles which leads to the strongest existing constraints on these states, satisfying our halo ellipticity bounds, over a wide range of monopole masses."
2108.01679,Horndeski stars,"We establish the existence of time-dependent solitons in a modified gravity framework, which is defined by the low energy limit of theories with a weakly broken galileon symmetry and a mass term.

When the central field amplitude is small the objects are indistinguishable from boson stars. In contrast, increasing the central value of the amplitude triggers the effect of higher derivative operators in the effective theory, leading to departures from the previous solutions, until the theory becomes strongly coupled and model-dependent. The higher order operators are part of the (beyond) Horndeski theory, hence the name of the compact objects. Moreover, a remnant of the galileon non-renormalization theorem guarantees that the existence and properties of these solutions are not affected by quantum corrections.

2010.12382,Euclid: impact of nonlinear prescriptions on cosmological parameter   estimation from weak lensing cosmic shear,"Upcoming surveys will map the growth of large-scale structure with unprecented precision, improving our understanding of the dark sector of the Universe. Unfortunately, much of the cosmological information is encoded by the small scales, where the clustering of dark matter and the effects of astrophysical feedback processes are not fully understood. This can bias the estimates of cosmological parameters, which we study here for a joint analysis of mock Euclid cosmic shear and Planck cosmic microwave background data. We use different implementations for the modelling of the signal on small scales and find that they result in significantly different predictions. Moreover, the different nonlinear corrections lead to biased parameter estimates, especially when the analysis is extended into the highly nonlinear regime, with both the Hubble constant, $H_0$, and the clustering amplitude, $\sigma_8$, affected the most. Improvements in the modelling of nonlinear scales will therefore be needed if we are to resolve the current tension with more and better data. For a given prescription for the nonlinear power spectrum, using different corrections for baryon physics does not significantly impact the precision of Euclid, but neglecting these correction does lead to large biases in the cosmological parameters. In order to extract precise and unbiased constraints on cosmological parameters from Euclid cosmic shear data, it is therefore essential to improve the accuracy of the recipes that account for nonlinear structure formation, as well as the modelling of the impact of astrophysical processes that redistribute the baryons.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Euclid: impact of nonlinear prescriptions on cosmological parameter   estimation from weak lensing cosmic shear

We give an intuitive, quasi-Newtonian derivation of all the effects that contribute to such an asymmetry in large-scale structure: gravitational redshift, Doppler shift, lensing, light-cone, evolution and Alcock-Paczynski effects - interestingly, the gravitational redshift term is exactly canceled by some of the others, assuming geodesic motion. Most of these effects are captured by previous calculations of general relativistic corrections to the observed galaxy density fluctuation; the asymmetry arises from terms that are suppressed by the ratio H/k - H is the Hubble constant and k is the wavenumber - which are more readily observable than the terms suppressed by (H/k)^2. Some of the contributions to the asymmetry, however, arise from terms that are generally considered 'Newtonian' - the lensing and evolution - and thus represent a contaminant in the search for general relativistic corrections. We propose methods to disentangle these different contributions. A simple method reduces the contamination to a level of < 10% for redshifts z<1.

We use the distribution of quasars measured by the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) to determine the turnover scale in a model-independent fashion statistically. We avoid modelling the BAO by down-weighting affected scales in the covariance matrix using the mode deprojection technique.

This upper limit is ~4 orders of magnitude greater than current observations, implying these are fully consistent with star formation in $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

In this paper, we study the impact of such background on the spatial distribution of both Dark Matter (DM) and galaxies, by coupling $N$-body numerical simulations with semi-analytic models (SAMs) of galaxy formation. Cosmological simulations including massive neutrinos predict a slower evolution of DM perturbations with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM runs with the same initial conditions and a suppression on the matter power spectrum on small and intermediate scales, thus impacting on the predicted properties of galaxy populations. We explicitly show that most of these deviations are driven by the different $\sigma_8$ predicted for cosmologies including a massive neutrino background. We conclude that independent estimates of $\sigma_8$ are needed, in order to unambiguously characterise the effect of this background on the growth of structures. Galaxy properties alone are a weak tracer of deviations with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM run, but their combination with the overall matter distribution at all scales allows to disentangle between different cosmological models.

2307.05917,Early dark energy induced by non-linear electrodynamics,"In this work, we introduce a parametrization of early dark energy that mimics radiation at early times and governs the present acceleration of the Universe. We show that such parametrization models non-linear electrodynamics in the early Universe and investigate the cosmological viability of the model.

We use a Bayesian method and the modular software \textsc{CosmoSIS} to find the best values for the model's free parameters with precomputed likelihoods from Planck 2018, primordial nucleosynthesis data, inferred distances from different wide galaxy surveys and luminosity distances of SNIa from Pantheon and SH0ES, such that $\gamma_s =$ 0.468 $\pm$ 0.026 and $\alpha =$ -0.947 $\pm$ 0.032, as opposed to $\Lambda$CDM where $\gamma_s = \beta =$ 0 and there is no equivalence for the $\alpha$ parameter.

We are the first to show that, at low redshift, component separation in visibility space suppresses foreground contamination at large line-of-sight scales, allowing measurement of HI power spectrum closer to the foreground wedge, crucial for data analysis towards future detections."

1204.4725,The 6dF Galaxy Survey: z \approx 0 measurement of the growth rate and   sigma_8,"We present a detailed analysis of redshift-space distortions in the two-point correlation function of the 6dF Galaxy Survey (6dFGS). The K-band selected sub-sample which we employ in this study contains 81971 galaxies distributed over 17000deg^2 with an effective redshift z = 0.067. By modelling the 2D galaxy correlation function, xi(r_p,pi), we measure the parameter combination f(z)sigma_8(z) = 0.423 +/- 0.055. Alternatively, by assuming standard gravity we can break the degeneracy between sigma_8 and the galaxy bias parameter, b. Combining our data with the Hubble constant prior from Riess et al (2011), we measure sigma_8 = 0.76 +/- 0.11 and Omega_m = 0.250 +/- 0.022, consistent with constraints from other galaxy surveys and the Cosmic Microwave Background data from WMAP7. Combining our measurement of fsigma_8 with WMAP7 allows us to test the relationship between matter and gravity on cosmic scales by constraining the growth index of density fluctuations, gamma. Using only 6dFGS and WMAP7 data we find gamma = 0.547 +/- 0.088, consistent with the prediction of General Relativity. We note that because of the low effective redshift of 6dFGS our measurement of the growth rate is independent of the fiducial cosmological model (Alcock-Paczynski effect). We also show that our conclusions are not sensitive to the model adopted for non-linear redshift-space distortions. Using a Fisher matrix analysis we report predictions for constraints on fsigma_8 for the WALLABY survey and the proposed TAIPAN survey. The WALLABY survey will be able to measure fsigma_8 with a precision of 4-10%, depending on the modelling of non-linear structure formation.

We use two complementary likelihood-free methods, namely Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Density-Estimation Likelihood-Free Inference (DELFI), to develop an analysis procedure for inference of the cosmological parameters $(\Omega_\mathrm{m},\sigma_8)$ and the mass scale of the survey sample. Adopting an eROSITA-like selection function and a 10-percent scatter in the observable-mass relation in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.286$ and $\sigma_8=0.82$, we create a synthetic catalog of observable-selected NFW clusters in a survey area of 50 deg$^2$.

Our derivation highlights terms that have previously been neglected but are important within the void interior. As a result our model differs from previous works and predicts new physical effects, including a change in the sign of the quadrupole term within the void radius. We show how the model can be generalised to include a velocity dispersion. We compare our model predictions to measurements of the correlation function using mock void and galaxy catalogues modelled after the BOSS CMASS galaxy sample using the Big MultiDark $N$-body simulation, and show that the linear model with dispersion provides an excellent fit to the data at all scales, $0\leq s\leq120\;h^{-1}$Mpc. While the RSD model matches simulations, the linear bias approximation does not hold within voids, and care is needed in fitting for the growth rate.

1302.1585,Galaxy gas ejection in radio galaxies: the case of 3C 35,"We report results from XMM-Newton and Chandra observations of the nearby (z = 0.067) giant radio galaxy 3C 35.

We also detect weak emission from a second, more extended group-type environment, as well as inverse-Compton X-ray emission from the radio lobes.

The Astrophysical Gravitational Wave Background (AGWB) is a collective signal of astrophysical gravitational wave sources and is dominated by compact binaries. Its measurement is one of the science goals of current and future gravitational wave detectors. Aims. We aim to determine what population of compact binaries dominates the AGWB in the mHz band. Methods. We revisit and update earlier work by Farmer & Phinney (2003) to model the astrophysical gravitational wave background sourced by extragalactic white dwarf binaries in the mHz frequency band. We calculate the signal using a single-metallicity model for the white dwarf population in the Universe using a global star formation history. Results. We estimate the white dwarf AGWB amplitude to be $\sim$ 60% larger than the earlier estimate and find that the overall shape of the white dwarf AGWB is well fitted by a broken power law combined with an exponential cut-off. Conclusions. We compare the results to the present-day best estimates for the background due to black hole and neutron star binaries, and find that the white dwarf component likely dominates in the mHz band. We provide an order of magnitude estimate that explains this hierarchy, and comment on the implications for future missions that aim to detect the AGWB.

 The Galactic Halo is a key target for indirect dark matter detection. The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory is a high-energy (~300 GeV to >100 TeV) gamma-ray detector located in central Mexico. HAWC operates via the water Cherenkov technique and has both a wide field of view of 2 sr and a >95% duty cycle, making it ideal for analyses of highly extended sources. We made use of these properties of HAWC and a new background-estimation technique optimized for extended sources to probe a large region of the Galactic Halo for dark matter signals.

In a merging system, the bias is expected to become most severe because the constituent halos undergo significant structural changes. In this study, we investigate WL mass bias in binary cluster mergers using a suite of idealized hydrodynamical simulations. Realistic WL shear catalogs are generated by matching the source galaxy properties, such as intrinsic shape dispersion, measurement noise, source densities, etc., to those from Subaru and {\it Hubble Space Telescope} observations. We find that, with the typical mass-concentration ($M$-$c$) relation and the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile, the halo mass bias depends on the time since the first pericenter passage and increases with the mass of the companion cluster. The time evolution of the mass bias is similar to that of the concentration, indicating that, to first order, the mass bias is modulated by the concentration change. For a collision between two $\sim10^{15}~M_{\odot}$ clusters, the maximum bias amounts to $\sim60\%$. This suggests that previous WL studies may have significantly overestimated the mass of the clusters in some of the most massive mergers.

Comparison to cosmological, chemodynamical stellar halo models confirm that the M giant population is particularly sensitive to rare, recent and massive accretion events. These events can give rise to local observed velocity sequences - a signature of a small fraction of debris from a common progenitor, passing at high velocity through the survey volume, near the pericenters of their eccentric orbits. The majority of the debris is found in much larger structures, whose morphologies are more cloud-like than stream-like and which lie at the orbital apocenters. Adopting this interpretation, the full-space motions represented by the observed velocity features are derived under the assumption that the members within each sequence share a common velocity. Orbit integrations are then used to trace the past and future trajectories of these stars across the sky revealing plausible associations with large, previously-discovered, cloud-like structures. The connections made between nearby velocity structures and these distant clouds represent preliminary steps towards developing coherent maps of such giant debris systems.

The \textsc{AbacusSummit} Ly$\alpha$ forest mocks open up the possibility for improved modelling of cross correlations between Ly$\alpha$ and cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing and Ly$\alpha$ and QSOs, and for forecasts of the 3-point Ly$\alpha$ correlation function. Our catalogues and skewers are publicly available on Globus."

The main objection against such scenarios is the absence of conventional radiation and matter-dominated critical points in the phase space of the model. This entails that radiation and matter dominance are not generic solutions of the cosmological equations, so that these stages can be implemented only by means of unique and very specific initial conditions, i. e., of very unstable particular solutions. Such a behavior is in marked contradiction with the accepted cosmological paradigm which requires of an earlier stage dominated by relativistic species, followed by a period of conventional non-relativistic matter domination, during which the cosmic structure we see was formed.

In this paper we present a study aimed to constrain the evolution, in the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1.2, of the mass content of different morphological types and its dependence on the environmental density. We use a deep multicolor catalog, covering an area of ~0.7 square degrees inside the COSMOS field, with accurate photometric redshifts (i < 26.5 and dz/(z+1) ~ 0.035). We estimate galaxy stellar masses by fitting the multi-color photometry to a grid of composite stellar population models.

We confirm an evolution of the morphological mix with redshift: the higher the redshift the more disk-dominated galaxies become important. We find that the morphological mix is a function of the local comoving density: the morphology density relation extends up to the highest redshift explored.   The stellar mass function of disk-dominated galaxies is consistent with being constant with redshift.

2207.07111,Equation of state of the running vacuum,"Recent studies of quantum field theory in FLRW spacetime suggest that the cause of the speeding up of the universe is the running vacuum (RV). Appropriate renormalization of the energy-momentum tensor shows that the vacuum energy density is a smooth function of the Hubble rate and its derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},...)$. This is because in QFT the quantum scaling of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ with the renormalization point turns into cosmic evolution with $H$. As a result, any two nearby points of the cosmic expansion during the standard FLRW epoch are smoothly related through $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(H^2)$.

Neglecting the presence of the inhomogeneity can in fact introduce a systematic misinterpretation of cosmological data, leading to the distinction between an apparent and true value of the cosmological constant. We establish the theoretical framework to calculate the corrections to the apparent value of the cosmological constant by modeling the local inhomogeneity with a $\Lambda LTB$ solution.

By performing a local Taylor expansion we analyze the number of independent degrees of freedom which determine the local shape of the inhomogeneity, and consider the issue of central smoothness, showing how the same correction can correspond to different inhomogeneity profiles.

1107.4772,Can 21-cm observations discriminate between high-mass and low-mass   galaxies as reionization sources?,"The prospect of detecting the first galaxies by observing their impact on the intergalactic medium as they reionized it during the first billion years leads us to ask whether such indirect observations are capable of diagnosing which types of galaxies were most responsible for reionization. We attempt to answer this by considering a set of large-scale radiative transfer simulations of reionization in sufficiently large volumes to make statistically meaningful predictions of observable signatures, while also directly resolving all atomically-cooling halos down to 10^8 M_solar. We focus here on predictions of the 21-cm background, to see if upcoming observations are capable of distinguishing a universe ionized primarily by high-mass halos from one in which both high-mass and low-mass halos are responsible, and to see how these results depend upon the uncertain source efficiencies. We find that 21-cm fluctuation power spectra observed by the first generation EoR/21-cm radio interferometer arrays should be able to distinguish the case of reionization by high-mass halos alone from that by both high- and low-mass halos, together. Some reionization scenarios yield very similar power spectra and rms evolution and thus can only be discriminated by their different mean reionization history and 21-cm PDF distributions. We find that the skewness of the 21-cm PDF distribution smoothed over LOFAR-like window shows a clear feature correlated with the rise of the rms due to patchiness. Measurements of the mean photoionization rates are sensitive to the average density of the regions being studied and therefore could be strongly skewed in certain cases.

1001.5218,A New Approach to Systematic Uncertainties and Self-Consistency in   Helium Abundance Determinations,"Tests of big bang nucleosynthesis and early universe cosmology require precision measurements for helium abundance determinations. However, efforts to determine the primordial helium abundance via observations of metal poor H II regions have been limited by significant uncertainties. This work builds upon previous work by providing an updated and extended program in evaluating these uncertainties. Procedural consistency is achieved by integrating the hydrogen based reddening correction with the helium based abundance calculation, i.e., all physical parameters are solved for simultaneously. We include new atomic data for helium recombination and collisional emission based upon recent work by Porter et al. and wavelength dependent corrections to underlying absorption are investigated. The set of physical parameters has been expanded here to include the effects of neutral hydrogen collisional emission. Because of a degeneracy between the solutions for density and temperature, the precision of the helium abundance determinations is limited. Also, at lower temperatures (T \lesssim 13,000 K) the neutral hydrogen fraction is poorly constrained resulting in a larger uncertainty in the helium abundances. Thus the derived errors on the helium abundances for individual objects are larger than those typical of previous studies. The updated emissivities and neutral hydrogen correction generally raise the abundance. From a regression to zero metallicity, we find Y_p as 0.2561 \pm 0.0108, in broad agreement with the WMAP result. Tests with synthetic data show a potential for distinct improvement, via removal of underlying absorption, using higher resolution spectra. A small bias in the abundance determination can be reduced significantly and the calculated helium abundance error can be reduced by \sim 25%.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"A New Approach to Systematic Uncertainties and Self-Consistency in   Helium Abundance Determinations

2011.11646,Black hole superradiance of self-interacting scalar fields,"Black hole superradiance is a powerful probe of light, weakly-coupled hidden sector particles. Many candidate particles, such as axions, generically have self-interactions that can influence the evolution of the superradiant instability. As pointed out in arXiv:1604.06422 in the context of a toy model, much of the existing literature on spin-0 superradiance does not take into account the most important self-interaction-induced processes. These processes lead to energy exchange between quasi-bound levels and particle emission to infinity; for large self-couplings, superradiant growth is saturated at a quasi-equilibrium configuration of reduced level occupation numbers. In this paper, we perform a detailed analysis of the rich dynamics of spin-0 superradiance with self-interactions, and the resulting observational signatures. We focus on quartic self-interactions, which dominate the evolution for most models of interest. We explore multiple distinct regimes of parameter space introduced by a non-zero self-interaction, including the simultaneous population of two or more bound levels; at large coupling, we confirm the basic picture of quasi-equilibrium saturation and provide evidence that the ""bosenova"" collapse does not occur in most of the astrophysical parameter space. Compared to gravitational superradiance, we find that gravitational wave ""annihilation"" signals and black hole spin-down are parametrically suppressed with increasing interactions, while new gravitational wave ""transition"" signals can take place for moderate interactions.

We use SDSS-measured Balmer emission line widths, $v_{\rm FWHM}$, as a proxy for disc circular velocity, $v_{\rm circ}$. A priori it is not clear whether we can construct accurate TFRs given the small $3""$ diameter of the fibres used for SDSS spectroscopic measurements. However, we show by modelling the H$\alpha$ emission profile as observed through a $3""$ aperture that for galaxies at appropriate redshifts ($z>0.045$) the fibres sample enough of the disc to obtain a linear relationship between $v_{\rm FWHM}$ and $v_{\rm circ}$, allowing us to obtain a TFR and to investigate dependence on other variables. We also develop a methodology for distinguishing between astrophysical and sample bias in the fibre TFR trends. We observe the well-known steepening of the TFR in redder bands in our sample. We divide the sample of galaxies into four equal groups using projected neighbour density ($\Sigma$) quartiles and find no significant dependence on environment, extending previous work to a wider range of environments and a much larger sample.

The significant presence of these anomalous spots, was initially noticed in the Planck 70 GHz satellite data by comparison with 1000 standard simulations, and then confirmed by extending the comparison to 10000 simulations. Such anomalous points were then found at precisely the same locations in the WMAP data, their significance confirmed by comparison with 1000 WMAP simulations.

1804.10761,Effects of biases in domain wall network evolution. II. Quantitative   analysis,"Domain walls form at phase transitions which break discrete symmetries. In a cosmological context they often overclose the universe (contrary to observational evidence), although one may prevent this by introducing biases or forcing anisotropic evolution of the walls. In a previous work [Correia {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.D90, 023521 (2014)] we numerically studied the evolution of various types of biased domain wall networks in the early universe, confirming that anisotropic networks ultimately reach scaling while those with a biased potential or biased initial conditions decay.

 Domain walls form at phase transitions which break discrete symmetries. In a cosmological context they often overclose the universe (contrary to observational evidence), although one may prevent this by introducing biases or forcing anisotropic evolution of the walls. In a previous work [Correia {\it et al.}, Phys.Rev.D90, 023521 (2014)] we numerically studied the evolution of various types of biased domain wall networks in the early universe, confirming that anisotropic networks ultimately reach scaling while those with a biased potential or biased initial conditions decay.

The deep K-band limit provided by UKIDSS allows for finding more heavily-reddened quasars at higher redshifts as compared with previous work using FIRST and 2MASS. We selected 87 candidates with K<=17.0 from the UKIDSS Large Area Survey (LAS) First Data Release (DR1) which covers 190 deg2. These candidates reach up to ~1.5 magnitudes below the 2MASS limit and obey the color criteria developed to identify dust-reddened quasars. We have obtained 61 spectroscopic observations in the optical and/or near-infrared as well as classifications in the literature and have identified 14 reddened quasars with E(B-V)>0.1, including three at z>2. We study the infrared properties of the sample using photometry from the WISE Observatory and find that infrared colors improve the efficiency of red quasar selection, removing many contaminants in an infrared-to-optical color-selected sample alone. The highest-redshift quasars (z > 2) are only moderately reddened, with E(B-V) ~ 0.2-0.3. We find that the surface density of red quasars rises sharply with faintness, comprising up to 17% of blue quasars at the same apparent K-band flux limit. We estimate that to reach more heavily reddened quasars (i.e., E(B-V) > 0.5) at z>2 and a depth of K=17 we would need to survey at least ~2.5 times more area.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Dust Reddened Quasars in FIRST and UKIDSS: Beyond the Tip of the Iceberg

2312.06756,Where are NANOGrav's big black holes?,"Multiple pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have recently reported the first detection of gravitational waves (GWs) of nanohertz frequencies. The signal is expected to be primarily sourced by inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) and these first results are broadly consistent with the expected GW spectrum from such a population. Curiously, the measured amplitude of the GW background in all announced results is a bit larger than theoretical predictions. In this work, we show that the amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) predicted from the present-day abundance of SMBHs derived from local scaling relations is significantly smaller than that measured by the PTAs. We demonstrate that this difference cannot be accounted for through changes in the merger history of SMBHs and that there is an upper limit to the boost to the characteristic strain from multiple merger events, due to the fact that they involve black holes of decreasing masses. If we require the current estimate of the black hole mass density -- equal to the integrated quasar luminosity function through the classic Soltan argument -- to be preserved, then the currently measured PTA result would imply that the typical total mass of SMBHs contributing to the background should be at least $\sim 3 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$, a factor of $\sim 10$ larger than previously predicted. The required space density of such massive black holes corresponds to order $10$ $3 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$ SMBHs within the volume accessible by stellar and gas dynamical SMBH measurements.

In this paper we review the properties of the environment of coalescing binaries in the context of the circumbinary disk and hot, radiatively inefficient accretion flow models and use them to mark the extent of the parameter space spanned by this problem. We report the results from an ongoing, general relativistic, hydrodynamical study of the inspiral and merger of black holes, motivated by the latter scenario.

1904.07253,Virgo: an unlikely cluster of galaxies because of its environment,"Galaxy clusters constitute powerful cosmological probes thanks to comparisons between observed and simulated clusters. As such Virgo constitutes a formidable source for detailed observations facilitated by its proximity. However, the diversity of clusters complicates the comparisons on a one-to-one basis. Simulated clusters must be carefully selected, a daunting task since most properties are unknown. Alternatively, lookalikes produced in the proper large scale environment can be used. Additionally, their statistical study give access to the mean properties of the observed cluster including its most probable history as well as its deviation from an average cluster. This paper presents such a statistical study with 200 Virgo-like and 400+ cluster-size random dark matter halos. Only 18%(0.5%) of these random halos comply within 3(2)-sigma with the mean values (radius, velocity dispersion, number of substructures, spin, velocity, concentration, center of mass offset with respect to the spherical center) of Virgo halos at z=0 and abide by a similar merging history up to redshift 4. None are within 1-sigma because of environmentally induced properties (number of substructures and velocity). For further comparisons, random halos are selected to reproduce the mass distribution of the lookalikes to cancel mass bias effects. Redshift 1 appears then as a turning point: random to Virgo-like property ratios are alternatively smaller/larger than 1.

 Galaxy clusters constitute powerful cosmological probes thanks to comparisons between observed and simulated clusters. As such Virgo constitutes a formidable source for detailed observations facilitated by its proximity. However, the diversity of clusters complicates the comparisons on a one-to-one basis. Simulated clusters must be carefully selected, a daunting task since most properties are unknown. Alternatively, lookalikes produced in the proper large scale environment can be used. Additionally, their statistical study give access to the mean properties of the observed cluster including its most probable history as well as its deviation from an average cluster. This paper presents such a statistical study with 200 Virgo-like and 400+ cluster-size random dark matter halos. Only 18%(0.5%) of these random halos comply within 3(2)-sigma with the mean values (radius, velocity dispersion, number of substructures, spin, velocity, concentration, center of mass offset with respect to the spherical center) of Virgo halos at z=0 and abide by a similar merging history up to redshift 4. None are within 1-sigma because of environmentally induced properties (number of substructures and velocity). For further comparisons, random halos are selected to reproduce the mass distribution of the lookalikes to cancel mass bias effects. Redshift 1 appears then as a turning point: random to Virgo-like property ratios are alternatively smaller/larger than 1. This highlights the importance of studying clusters within their proper large scale environment: simulated galaxy population, grandly affected by the cluster history, can then be compared with the observed one in details. Direct lookalikes simplify grandly the challenge."

We find a scaling relation $P_{\rm cav} \propto L_{148}^{\beta}$, with a logarithmic slope of $\beta = 0.51 \pm 0.14$, which is in good agreement with previous results based on data at 327 MHz. The large scatter present in this correlation confirms the conclusion reached at higher frequencies that the total radio luminosity at a single frequency is a poor predictor of the total jet power. We show that including measurements at 148 MHz alone is insufficient to reliably compute the bolometric radio luminosity and reduce the scatter in the correlation.

Meanwhile, baryon physics (particularly AGN feedback) has previously been shown to strongly affect the two-point statistics but there has been limited exploration of its effects on higher-order functions to date. Here we use the BAHAMAS suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations to explore the effects of baryon physics and massive neutrinos on the halo bispectrum. In contrast to matter clustering which is suppressed by baryon physics, we find that the halo clustering is typically enhanced. The strength of the effect and the scale over which it extends depends on how haloes are selected. On small scales (k > 1 $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, dominated by satellites of groups/clusters), we find that the bispectrum is highly sensitive to the efficiency of star formation and feedback, making it an excellent testing ground for galaxy formation models.

In this regime, HI is likely to represent most of the ISM and FUV emission to trace recent star formation with little bias due to extinction, so that the two quantities closely trace the underlying relationship between gas and star formation rate (SFR). The azimuthally averaged HI and FUV intensities both decline with increasing radius in this regime, with the scale length of the FUV profile typically half that of the HI profile. Despite the mismatch in profiles, there is a significant spatial correlation (at 15"" resolution) between local FUV and HI intensities; near r25 this correlation is quite strong, in fact stronger than anywhere inside r25, and shows a decline towards larger radii. The star formation efficiency (SFE) - defined as the ratio of FUV/HI and thus the inverse of the gas depletion time - decreases with galactocentric radius across the outer disks, though much shallower than across the optical disks.

Despite observing systematic variations in FUV/HI, we find no clear evidence for step-function type star formation thresholds.

Some models of inflation have been shown to be incompatible with these criterion while some have been shown to be severely fine tuned, with most of these problems arising in single field inflationary models in a General relativistic cosmology. Recent works have although optimistically shown that single field models in more general cosmologies can be consistent with these conjectures and hence there is an optimism that not all such models lie in the swampland.

So in this work, we discuss Tachyonic inflation in the high energy RS-II Braneworld scenario in the context of the swampland conjectures while also considering the possibility of swampland consistent eternal inflation. We show that our concerned regime evades all the prominent swampland issues for single field inflation being virtually unscathed.

We use hydrodynamic cosmological simulations including in situ multifrequency radiative transfer to evaluate the effects of a high binary fraction in reionization-era galaxies on traits of the early intergalactic medium and the abundance of H I and He II ionizing photons. We further extend this to analyze the traits of enriched gas. In comparing metrics generated using a fiducial simulation assuming single stars with one incorporating a high binary fraction, we find that binary stars cause H I reionization to complete earlier and at an accelerated pace, while also increasing the abundances of high-ionization metals (C IV and Si IV) in simulated absorption spectra while reducing the abundance of low-ionization states (O I, Si II, and C II). However, through increased photoheating of galactic and circumgalactic gas, they simultaneously reduce the rate of star formation in low-mass galaxies, slowing the ongoing process of enrichment and suppressing their own ionizing background.

The gas accreting on a PBH heats up by the release of the gravitational energy. As a result, the heated gas in the vicinity of the PBH emits the UV and X-ray photons. These photons can ionize and heat the intergalactic medium (IGM) around the PBH. Assuming the simple model of these emitting photons, we compute the profiles of the IGM ionization fraction and temperature around a PBH. Using these profiles, we evaluate the Compton $y$-parameter created by the IGM gas around a PBH. Finally, we estimate the CMB temperature angular power spectrum due to the PBH SZ effect in our model. We show that the SZ temperature anisotropy due to the PBHs has the flat angular power spectrum on small scale, $l\leq2000$ and could dominate the primordial temperature spectrum on smaller scales than the Silk scale. This flat spectrum extends to the scale of the ionized region by the PBH emission.

1003.0004,Multiple Weak Deflections in Galaxy-Galaxy Lensing,"The frequency and effects of multiple weak deflections in galaxy-galaxy lensing are investigated via Monte Carlo simulations. The lenses in the simulations are galaxies with known redshifts and known rest-frame blue luminosities. The frequency of multiple deflections above a given threshold shear value is quantified for discrete source redshifts, as well as for a set of sources that are broadly distributed in redshift space. In general, the closest lens in projection on the sky is not the only lens for a given source. In addition, ~50% of the time the closest lens is not the most important lens for a given source. Compared to a naive single-deflection calculation in which only the lensing due to the closest weak lens is considered, a full multiple-deflection calculation yields a higher net shear for individual sources, as well as a higher mean tangential shear around the lens centers. The full multiple-deflection calculation also shows that galaxy-galaxy lensing may contribute a substantial amount to cosmic shear on small angular scales. The degree to which galaxy-galaxy lensing contributes to the small-scale cosmic shear is, however, quite sensitive to the mass adopted for the halos of L_B* galaxies. Changing the halo mass by a factor of ~2.5 changes the contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to the cosmic shear by a factor of ~3 on scales of order 1 arcmin. The contribution of galaxy-galaxy lensing to cosmic shear decreases rapidly with angular scale and extrapolates to zero at scales of order 5 arcmin.

The local space density of wet mergers is essentially dentical to the local space density of dry mergers. The evolution in the total merger rate is modest out to z ~ 0.7, although the wet and dry populations have different evolutionary trends. At higher redshifts dry mergers make a smaller contribution to the total merging galaxy population, but this is offset by a roughly equivalent increase in the contribution from wet mergers. By comparing the mass density function of early-type galaxies to the corresponding mass density function for merging systems, we show that not all the major mergers with the highest masses (M_stellar > 10^11 M_solar) will end up with the most massive early-type galaxies, unless the merging timescale is dramatically longer than that usually assumed. On the other hand, the usually-assumed merging timescale of ~ 0.5-1 Gyr is quite consistent with the data if we suppose that only less massive early-type galaxies form via mergers.

We find that the iron mass fraction measured in the inner 0.15 R500 shows a larger dispersion across the sample of low-mass clusters, than it does for the sample of high-mass clusters. We interpret this finding as the result of the mixing of more haloes in large clusters than in small clusters, which leads to an averaging of the metal content in the large clusters, and thus less dispersion of metallicity for high-mass clusters. This interpretation lends support to the idea that the low-entropy, metal-rich gas of merging haloes reaches clusters' centers, which explains observations of Core-Collapse Supernova products metallicity peaks, and which is seen in hydrodynamical simulations. The gas in these merging haloes would have to reach the centers of clusters without mixing in the outer regions, in order to support our interpretation. On the other hand, metallicity dispersion does not change with mass in the outer regions of clusters, suggesting that most of the outer metals come from a source with a more uniform metallicity level, such as during pre-enrichment.

Although the Calcium-rich gap transients make up only a small fraction of all supernovae events, we find that their high Calcium yields are sufficient to reproduce the X-ray measurements found for nearby rich clusters. We find the $\chi^{2}$ goodness-of-fit metric improves from 84 to 2 by including this new class. Moreover, Calcium-rich supernovae preferentially occur in the outskirts of galaxies making it easier for the nucleosynthesis products of these events to be incorporated in the intracluster medium via ram-pressure stripping. The discovery of a Calcium-rich gap transients in clusters and groups far from any individual galaxy suggests supernovae associated with intracluster stars may play an important role in enriching the intracluster medium. Calcium-rich gap transients may also help explain anomalous Calcium abundances in many other astrophysical systems including individual stars in the Milky Way, the halos of nearby galaxies and the circumgalactic medium.

We find the $\chi^{2}$ goodness-of-fit metric improves from 84 to 2 by including this new class. Moreover, Calcium-rich supernovae preferentially occur in the outskirts of galaxies making it easier for the nucleosynthesis products of these events to be incorporated in the intracluster medium via ram-pressure stripping. The discovery of a Calcium-rich gap transients in clusters and groups far from any individual galaxy suggests supernovae associated with intracluster stars may play an important role in enriching the intracluster medium. Calcium-rich gap transients may also help explain anomalous Calcium abundances in many other astrophysical systems including individual stars in the Milky Way, the halos of nearby galaxies and the circumgalactic medium. Our work highlights the importance of considering the diversity of supernovae types and corresponding yields when modeling the abundance of the intracluster medium and other gas reservoirs."

2402.08716,Axion dark matter from inflation-driven quantum phase transition,"We propose a new mechanism to produce axion dark matter from inflationary fluctuations. Quantum fluctuations during inflation are strengthened by a coupling of the axion kinetic term to the inflaton, which we parametrize as an effective curvature $\kappa$ in the axion equation of motion. A nonvanishing curvature breaks the scale invariance of the axion power spectrum, driving a quantum phase transition with $\kappa$ as the order parameter. The axion power spectrum is proportional to the inverse comoving horizon to the power of $\kappa$. For positive $\kappa$ the spectrum gets a red tilt, leading to an exponential enhancement of the axion abundance as the comoving horizon shrinks during inflation. This enhancement allows sufficient axion production to comprise the entire dark matter relic abundance despite the ultralight mass. Our mechanism predicts a significantly different parameter space from the usual misalignment mechanism. It allows for axion-like particle dark matter with a much lower decay constant and thus a larger coupling to Standard Model particles.

We provide linelists and equivalent widths for all detected lines redward of Ly-alpha.

For that purpose we define an X-ray selected sample of Swift bursts with optimal conditions for ground-based follow up from the period March 2005 to September 2008; 146 bursts fulfill our sample criteria. We derive the redshift distribution for this sample and conclude that less than 19% of Swift bursts are at z>7. We compare the high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i) bursts with redshifts measured from OA spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detected OA, but no OA-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the OA. The bursts in group i) have significantly less excess X-ray absorption than bursts in the other two groups. In addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% in group i), 38% in group ii) and > 39% in group iii). From this we conclude that the sample of GRBs with OA spectroscopy is not representative for all Swift bursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. Finally, we characterize GRB absorption systems as a class and compare them to QSO absorption systems, in particular DLAs. On average GRB absorbers are characterized by significantly stronger EWs for HI as well as for both low and high ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening QSO absorbers.

We derive the redshift distribution for this sample and conclude that less than 19% of Swift bursts are at z>7. We compare the high energy properties for three sub-samples of bursts in the sample: i) bursts with redshifts measured from OA spectroscopy, ii) bursts with detected OA, but no OA-based redshift, and iii) bursts with no detection of the OA. The bursts in group i) have significantly less excess X-ray absorption than bursts in the other two groups. In addition, the fraction of dark bursts is 14% in group i), 38% in group ii) and > 39% in group iii). From this we conclude that the sample of GRBs with OA spectroscopy is not representative for all Swift bursts, most likely due to a bias against the most dusty sight-lines. Finally, we characterize GRB absorption systems as a class and compare them to QSO absorption systems, in particular DLAs. On average GRB absorbers are characterized by significantly stronger EWs for HI as well as for both low and high ionization metal lines than what is seen in intervening QSO absorbers. Based on the z>2 bursts in the sample we place a 95% confidence upper limit of 7.5% on the mean escape fraction of ionizing photons from star-forming galaxies."
1605.07619,Systematic biases in low frequency radio interferometric data due to   calibration: the LOFAR EoR case,"The redshifted 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). However, its detection requires a thorough understanding and control of the systematic errors. We study two systematic biases observed in the LOFAR EoR residual data after calibration and subtraction of bright discrete foreground sources. The first effect is a suppression in the diffuse foregrounds, which could potentially mean a suppression of the 21 cm signal. The second effect is an excess of noise beyond the thermal noise. The excess noise shows fluctuations on small frequency scales, and hence it can not be easily removed by foreground removal or avoidance methods. Our analysis suggests that sidelobes of residual sources due to the chromatic point spread function and ionospheric scintillation can not be the dominant causes of the excess noise. Rather, both the suppression of diffuse foregrounds and the excess noise can occur due to calibration with an incomplete sky model containing predominantly bright discrete sources. We show that calibrating only on bright sources can cause suppression of other signals and introduce an excess noise in the data. The levels of the suppression and excess noise depend on the relative flux of sources which are not included in the model with respect to the flux of modeled sources. We discuss possible solutions such as using only long baselines to calibrate the interferometric gain solutions as well as simultaneous multi-frequency calibration along with their benefits and shortcomings.",astro-ph.IM astro-ph.CO,"Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics, Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Systematic biases in low frequency radio interferometric data due to   calibration: the LOFAR EoR case

We study the luminosity functions (LF) and the dependence of the specific star formation rate (SSFR) on stellar mass, galaxy type, and projected distance to the groups that define the filaments.

A similar shape-dynamics correlation, independent of mass, is also found in the SDSS DR7 groups of galaxies and in order to investigate its cause we have tested and used, as a proxy of the group formation time, a concentration parameter. We have found, as in the case of the simulated haloes, that less concentrated groups, corresponding to late formation times, have lower velocity dispersions and higher elongations than groups with higher values of concentration, corresponding to early formation times."
1309.4093,The Intrinsic Scatter Along The Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies   at z ~ 0.7,"A sample of 12614 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) with stellar mass >10^9.5 M_sun between 0.6<z<0.8 from COSMOS is selected to study the intrinsic scatter of the correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass. We derive SFR from ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) luminosities. A stacking technique is adopted to measure IR emission for galaxies undetected at 24 micron. We confirm that the slope of the mass-SFR relation is close to unity. We examine the distributions of specific SFRs (SSFRs) in four equally spaced mass bins from 10^9.5 M_sun to 10^11.5 M_sun. Different models are used to constrain the scatter of SSFR for lower mass galaxies that are mostly undetected at 24 micron. The SFR scatter is dominated by the scatter of UV luminosity and gradually that of IR luminosity at increasing stellar mass. We derive SSFR dispersions of 0.18, 0.21, 0.26 and 0.31 dex with a typical measurement uncertainty of <~ 0.01 dex for the four mass bins. Interestingly, the scatter of the mass-SFR relation seems not constant in the sense that the scatter in SSFR is smaller for SFGs of stellar mass <10^10.5 M_sun. If confirmed, this suggests that the physical processes governing star formation become systematically less violent for less massive galaxies. The SSFR distribution for SFGs with intermediate mass 10^10-10^10.5 M_sun is characterized by a prominent excess of intense starbursts in comparison with other mass bins.

1806.10596,A Hubble constant measurement from superluminal motion of the jet in   GW170817,"The Hubble constant ($H_0$) measures the current expansion rate of the Universe, and plays a fundamental role in cosmology. Tremendous effort has been dedicated over the past decades to measure $H_0$. Notably, Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) and the local Cepheid-supernovae distance ladder measurements determine $H_0$ with a precision of $\sim 1\%$ and $\sim 2\%$ respectively. A $3$-$\sigma$ level of discrepancy exists between the two measurements, for reasons that have yet to be understood. Gravitational wave (GW) sources accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts offer a completely independent standard siren (the GW analogue of an astronomical standard candle) measurement of $H_0$, as demonstrated following the discovery of the neutron star merger, GW170817. This measurement does not assume a cosmological model and is independent of a cosmic distance ladder. The first joint analysis of the GW signal from GW170817 and its EM localization led to a measurement of $H_0=74^{+16}_{-8}$ km/s/Mpc (median and symmetric $68\%$ credible interval). In this analysis, the degeneracy in the GW signal between the source distance and the weakly constrained viewing angle dominated the $H_0$ measurement uncertainty. Recently, Mooley et al.

Recent studies found that these data place stringent constraints on the maximum abundance of EDE allowed in the Universe. We argue here that their conclusions are a consequence of their choice of priors on the EDE parameter space, rather than any disagreement between the data and the model. For example, when considering EFT-LSS, CMB, and high-redshift supernovae data we find the EDE and $\Lambda$CDM models can provide statistically indistinguishable fits ($\Delta \chi^2 = 0.12$) with a relatively large value for the maximum fraction of energy density in the EDE ($f_{\rm ede} = 0.09$) and Hubble constant ($H_0 = 71$ km/s/Mpc) in the EDE model. Moreover, we demonstrate that the constraining power added from the inclusion of EFT-LSS traces to the potential tension between the power-spectrum amplitudes $A_s$ derived from BOSS and from Planck that arises even within the context of $\Lambda$CDM. Until this is better understood, caution should be used when interpreting EFT-BOSS+Planck constraints to models beyond $\Lambda$CDM.

2104.09527,Kinematics of MgII Absorbers from the Redshift-space Distortion Around   Massive Quiescent Galaxies,"The kinematics of MgII absorbers is the key to understanding the origin of cool, metal-enriched gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium of massive quiescent galaxies. Exploiting the fact that the cloud line-of-sight velocity distribution is the only unknown for predicting the redshift-space distortion~(RSD) of MgII absorbers from their 3D real-space distribution around galaxies, we develop a novel method to infer the cool cloud kinematics from the redshift-space galaxy-cloud cross-correlation $\xi^{s}$. We measure $\xi^{s}$ for ${\sim}10^4$ MgII absorbers around ${\sim}8{\times}10^5$ CMASS galaxies at $0.4{<}z{<}0.8$. We discover that $\xi^{s}$ does not exhibit a strong Fingers-of-God effect, but is heavily truncated at velocity ${\sim}300\,km/s$. We reconstruct both the redshift and real-space cloud number density distributions inside haloes, $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ and $\xi_{1h}$, respectively. Thus, for any model of cloud kinematics, we can predict $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ from the reconstructed $\xi_{1h}$, and self-consistently compare to the observed $\xi^{s}_{1h}$. We consider four types of cloud kinematics, including an isothermal model with a single velocity dispersion, a satellite infall model in which cool clouds reside in the subhaloes, a cloud accretion model in which clouds follow the cosmic gas accretion, and a tired wind model in which clouds originate from the galactic wind-driven bubbles.

 The kinematics of MgII absorbers is the key to understanding the origin of cool, metal-enriched gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium of massive quiescent galaxies. Exploiting the fact that the cloud line-of-sight velocity distribution is the only unknown for predicting the redshift-space distortion~(RSD) of MgII absorbers from their 3D real-space distribution around galaxies, we develop a novel method to infer the cool cloud kinematics from the redshift-space galaxy-cloud cross-correlation $\xi^{s}$. We measure $\xi^{s}$ for ${\sim}10^4$ MgII absorbers around ${\sim}8{\times}10^5$ CMASS galaxies at $0.4{<}z{<}0.8$. We discover that $\xi^{s}$ does not exhibit a strong Fingers-of-God effect, but is heavily truncated at velocity ${\sim}300\,km/s$. We reconstruct both the redshift and real-space cloud number density distributions inside haloes, $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ and $\xi_{1h}$, respectively. Thus, for any model of cloud kinematics, we can predict $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ from the reconstructed $\xi_{1h}$, and self-consistently compare to the observed $\xi^{s}_{1h}$.

We analyse the evolution of cold dark matter density perturbations allowing for the possibility of bulk viscous pressure in a causal dissipative theory. Our analysis employs a Newtonian approximation for cosmological dynamics and the transport properties of bulk viscosity are described by the Israel--Stewart theory. We obtain a third order evolution equation for density perturbations. For some parameter values the density contrast can be suppressed compared to results obtained in the $\Lambda$CDM scenario.

1201.4711,Indications for a pair-production anomaly from the propagation of VHE   gamma-rays,"In the recent years, the number of detected very high energy (VHE: E > 100 GeV) gamma-ray sources has increased rapidly. The sources have been observed at redshifts up to z = 0.536 without strong indications for the presence of absorption features in the energy spectra. Absorption is however expected due to pair-production processes of the propagating photons with the photon bath in intergalactic space. Even though this photon density is not well known, lower limits can be firmly set by the resolved emission from galaxy counts. Using this guaranteed background light, we investigate the behaviour of the energy spectra in the transition region from the optically thin to the optically thick regime.

For these sources, the transition to $\tau > 2$ takes place at widely different energies ranging from 0.4 TeV to 21 TeV. Consistently, in all of these sources, an upturn of the absorption-corrected spectrum is visible at this transition with a combined significance of 4.2 standard deviations. Given the broad range of energies and redshifts covered by the sample, source-intrinsic features are unlikely to explain the observed effect.

We propose leveraging scintillation in the ISM to resolve the microlensed images, effectively turning the ISM into an astrophysical-scale interferometer. Using this technique, we estimate a 6\% uncertainty on $H_0$ from a single observed scintillated microlensing event, with a sub-percent uncertainty on $H_0$ achievable with only 30 such events.

The specific angular momentum of the stellar component always decreases independent of the orbital parameters or morphology of the satellite, the decrease in the rotation velocity of the primary galaxy is accompanied by a change in the anisotropy of the orbits, and the ratio of rotation speed to velocity dispersion of the merger remnant is lower than the initial value, not only due to an increase in the dispersion but also to the slowing -down of the disk rotation. We briefly discuss several astrophysical implications of these results, suggesting that minor mergers do not cause a ""random walk"" process of the angular momentum of the stellar disk component of galaxies, but rather a steady decrease.

This result is surprising as clusters are at mass scales that are {\em a thousand times greater} than that at which structure formation is suppressed. WDM clusters gain significantly more mass via smooth accretion and contain fewer substructures than their CDM brethren.

We find, unexpectedly, that WDM clusters have {\em higher} lensing efficiencies than those in CDM cosmologies, contrary to the naive expectation that WDM clusters should be less efficient due to the fewer substructures they contain. Despite being less dense, the larger WDM subhaloes are more likely to have larger lensing cross-sections than CDM ones.

Their dispersive arrival times suggest an extragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities orders of magnitude larger than any other kind of known short-duration radio transient. Thus far, all FRBs have been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute localizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host galaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the presence of peculiar field stars or galaxies.

1310.0466,The Orbital Ellipticity of Satellite Galaxies and the Mass of the Milky   Way,"We use simulations of Milky Way-sized dark matter haloes from the Aquarius Project to investigate the orbits of substructure haloes likely, according to a semi-analytic galaxy formation model, to host luminous satellites. These tend to populate the most massive subhaloes and are on more radial orbits than the majority of subhaloes found within the halo virial radius. One reason for this (mild) kinematic bias is that many low-mass subhaloes have apocentres that exceed the virial radius of the main host; they are thus excluded from subhalo samples identified within the virial boundary, reducing the number of subhalos on radial orbits. Two other factors contributing to the difference in orbital shape between dark and luminous subhaloes are their dynamical evolution after infall, which affects more markedly low-mass (dark) subhaloes, and a weak dependence of ellipticity on the redshift of first infall. The ellipticity distribution of luminous satellites exhibits little halo-to-halo scatter and it may therefore be compared fruitfully with that of Milky Way satellites. Since the latter depends sensitively on the total mass of the Milky Way we can use the predicted distribution of satellite ellipticities to place constraints on this important parameter. Using the latest estimates of position and velocity of dwarfs compiled from the literature, we find that the most likely Milky Way mass lies in the range $6 \times 10^{11} M_{\odot} < M_{200} < 3.1 \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$, with a best fit value of $M_{200} = 1.1 \times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$.

In this first paper resulting from the survey, we report on the discovery of the galaxy counterpart of the z_abs = 2.354 DLA towards the z=2.926 quasar Q2222$-0946.

Isolated primary galaxies are identified in the SDSS spectroscopic sample while potential satellites (that are up to 4 magnitudes fainter than their hosts) are searched for in the much deeper photometric sample. Filaments are constructed from the galaxy distribution by the ""Bisous"" process. Isolated primary galaxies are divided into two subsamples: those in filaments and those not in filaments. We examine the stacked mean satellite LF of both the filament and non-filament sample and find that, on average, the satellite LFs of galaxies in filaments is significantly higher than those of galaxies not in filaments. The filamentary environment can increases the abundance of the brightest satellites ($M_\mathrm{sat.} < M_\mathrm{prim.} + 2.0$), by a factor of $\sim 2$ compared with non-filament isolated galaxies. This result is independent of primary galaxy magnitude although the satellite LF of galaxies in the faintest magnitude bin, is too noisy to determine if such a dependence exists. Since our filaments are extracted from a spectroscopic flux-limited sample, we consider the possibility that the difference in satellite LF is due to a redshift, colour or environmental bias, finding these to be insufficient to explain our result.

We examine the stacked mean satellite LF of both the filament and non-filament sample and find that, on average, the satellite LFs of galaxies in filaments is significantly higher than those of galaxies not in filaments. The filamentary environment can increases the abundance of the brightest satellites ($M_\mathrm{sat.} < M_\mathrm{prim.} + 2.0$), by a factor of $\sim 2$ compared with non-filament isolated galaxies. This result is independent of primary galaxy magnitude although the satellite LF of galaxies in the faintest magnitude bin, is too noisy to determine if such a dependence exists. Since our filaments are extracted from a spectroscopic flux-limited sample, we consider the possibility that the difference in satellite LF is due to a redshift, colour or environmental bias, finding these to be insufficient to explain our result. The dependence of the satellite LF on the cosmic web suggests that the filamentary environment may have a strong effect on the efficiency of galaxy formation."

1709.03499,"Stochastic Order Redshift Technique (SORT): a simple, efficient and   robust method to improve cosmological redshift measurements","We present a simple, efficient and robust approach to improve cosmological redshift measurements. The method is based on the presence of a reference sample for which a precise redshift number distribution (dN/dz) can be obtained for different pencil-beam-like sub-volumes within the original survey. For each sub-volume we then impose: (i) that the redshift number distribution of the uncertain redshift measurements matches the reference dN/dz corrected by their selection functions; and (ii) the rank order in redshift of the original ensemble of uncertain measurements is preserved. The latter step is motivated by the fact that random variables drawn from Gaussian probability density functions (PDFs) of different means and arbitrarily large standard deviations satisfy stochastic ordering. We then repeat this simple algorithm for multiple arbitrary pencil-beam-like overlapping sub-volumes; in this manner, each uncertain measurement has multiple (non-independent) ""recovered"" redshifts which can be used to estimate a new redshift PDF. We refer to this method as the Stochastic Order Redshift Technique (SORT). We have used a state-of-the-art N-body simulation to test the performance of SORT under simple assumptions and found that it can improve the quality of cosmological redshifts in an efficient and robust manner. Particularly, SORT redshifts are able to recover the distinctive features of the 'cosmic web' and can provide unbiased measurement of the two-point correlation function on scales > 4 Mpc/h.

2012.05077,Redshift space power spectrum beyond Einstein-de Sitter kernels,"We develop a framework to compute the redshift space power spectrum (PS), with kernels beyond Einstein-de Sitter (EdS), that can be applied to a wide variety of generalized cosmologies. We build upon a formalism that was recently employed for standard cosmology in Chen, Vlah & White (2020), and utilize an expansion of the density-weighted velocity moment generating function that explicitly separates the magnitude of the $k$-modes and their angle to the line-of-sight direction dependencies. We compute the PS for matter and biased tracers to 1-loop Perturbation Theory (PT) and show that the expansion has a correct infrared and ultraviolet behavior, free of unwanted divergences. We also add Effective Field Theory (EFT) counterterms, necessary to account for small-scale contributions to PT, and employ an IR-resummation prescription to properly model the smearing of the BAO due to large scale bulk flows within Standard-PT. To demonstrate the applicability of our formalism, we apply it on the $\Lambda$CDM and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ models, and compare our numerical results against the ELEPHANT suite of $N$-body simulations, finding very good agreement up to $k= 0.27\, \text{Mpc}^{-1} h$ at $z=0.5$ for the first three non-vanishing Legendre multipoles of the PS. To our knowledge, the model presented in this work is the most accurate theoretical EFT-PT for modified gravity to date, being the only one that accounts for beyond linear local biasing in redshift-space.

High spatial and mass resolutions of 12pc and 4x10^4 M_sol allow to resolve cold and turbulent gas clouds embedded in a warmer diffuse phase. We compare to lower resolution models, where the multiphase ISM is not resolved and is modeled as a relatively homogeneous and stable medium. While merger-driven bursts of star formation are generally attributed to large-scale gas inflows towards the nuclear regions, we show that once a realistic ISM is resolved, the dominant process is actually gas fragmentation into massive and dense clouds and rapid star formation therein. As a consequence, star formation is more efficient by a factor of up to 10 and is also somewhat more extended, while the gas density probability distribution function (PDF) rapidly evolves towards very high densities. We thus propose that the actual mechanism of starburst triggering in galaxy collisions can only be captured at high spatial resolution and when the cooling of gas is modeled down to less than 10^3 K.

We show that nontrivial cosmology beyond $\Lambda$CDM falls within the uncertainties of the reconstructions from growth data, which therefore indicates no significant departure from the concordance cosmological model."
2008.11685,Large-N Expansion and String Theory Out of Equilibrium,"We analyze the large-$N$ expansion of general non-equilibrium systems with fluctuating matrix degrees of freedom and $SU(N)$ symmetry, using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and its closed real-time contour with a forward and backward component. In equilibrium, the large-$N$ expansion of such systems leads to a sum over topologies of two-dimensional surfaces of increasing topological complexity, predicting the possibility of a dual description in terms of string theory. We extend this argument away from equilibrium, and study the universal features of the topological expansion in the dual string theory. We conclude that in non-equilibrium string perturbation theory, the sum over worldsheet topologies is further refined: Each worldsheet surface $\Sigma$ undergoes a triple decomposition into the part $\Sigma^+$ corresponding to the forward branch of the time contour, the part $\Sigma^-$ on the backward branch, and the part $\Sigma^\wedge$ that corresponds to the instant in the far future where the two branches of the time contour meet. The sum over topologies becomes a sum over the triple decompositions. We generalize our findings to the Kadanoff-Baym time contour relevant for systems at finite temperature, and to the case of closed and open, oriented or unoriented strings.

1006.2137,The LABOCA survey of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South: A   photometric redshift survey of submillimetre galaxies,"[abridged] We derive photometric redshifts from 17-band optical to mid-IR photometry of 74 robust counterparts to 68 of the 126 submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) selected at 870um by LABOCA observations in the ECDFS. The median photometric redshift of identified SMGs is z=2.2\pm0.1, the interquartile range is z=1.8-2.7 and we identify 10 (~15%) high-redshift (z>3) SMGs. We derive a simple redshift estimator for SMGs based on the 3.6 and 8um fluxes, which is accurate to Delta_z~0.4 for SMGs at z<4. A statistical analysis of sources around unidentified SMGs identifies a population of likely counterparts with a redshift distribution peaking at z=2.5\pm0.3, which likely comprises ~60% of the unidentified SMGs. This confirms that the bulk of the undetected SMGs are coeval with those detected in the radio/mid-IR. We conclude that ~15% of all the SMGs are below the flux limits of our survey and lie at z>3 and hence ~30% of all SMGs have z>3. We estimate that the full S_870um>4mJy SMG population has a median redshift of 2.5\pm0.6. In contrast to previous suggestions we find no significant correlation between S_870um and redshift. The median stellar mass of the SMGs derived from SED fitting is (9.2\pm0.9)x10^10Msun and the interquartile range is (4.7-14)x10^10Msun, although we caution that uncertainty in the star-formation histories results in a factor of ~5 uncertainty in these stellar masses. The median characteristic dust temperature of SMGs is 35.9\pm1.4K and the interquartile range is 28.5-43.3K. The infrared luminosity function shows that SMGs at z=2-3 typically have higher far-IR luminosities and luminosity density than those at z=1-2. This is mirrored in the evolution of the star-formation rate density (SFRD) for SMGs which peaks at z~2.

We find that both steps of the analysis have a large impact on the resulting c-M relation. In particular, we show that the two c-M relations can be entirely reconciled, if we account for these methodological differences.

The distribution of the equivalent width as a function of the impact parameter shows that, unlike the case of normal galaxies, some strong absorption systems (EWr > 1 Ang) are present also beyond a projected radius of ~70 kpc.

1410.1385,Collisional production of sterile neutrinos via secret interactions and   cosmological implications,"Secret interactions among sterile neutrinos have been recently proposed as an escape-route to reconcile eV sterile neutrino hints from short-baseline anomalies with cosmological observations. In particular models with coupling g_X \gtrsim 10^{-2} and gauge boson mediators $X$ with $M_X \lesssim 10$ MeV lead to large matter potential suppressing the sterile neutrino production before the neutrino decoupling. With this choice of parameter ranges, big bang nucleosynthesis is left unchanged and gives no bound on the model. However, we show that at lower temperatures when active-sterile oscillations are no longer matter suppressed, sterile neutrinos are still in a collisional regime, due to their secret self-interactions. The interplay between vacuum oscillations and collisions leads to a scattering-induced decoherent production of sterile neutrinos with a fast rate. This process is responsible for a flavor equilibration among the different neutrino species. We explore the effect of this large sterile neutrino population on cosmological observables. We find that a signature of strong secret interactions would be a reduction of the effective number of neutrinos $N_{\rm eff}$ at matter radiation equality down to 2.7. Moreover, for $M_X \gtrsim g_X$ MeV sterile neutrinos would be free-streaming before becoming non-relativistic and they would affect the large-scale structure power spectrum.

Finally, we consider the vacuum selection problem in string theory, where we show a network-centered approach yields a dynamical mechanism for vacuum selection in the context of multiverse cosmology. These algorithms have broad applicability to many physical systems, and they improve existing methods by reducing simulation runtimes by orders of magnitude."
2307.11896,A viable $f(R)$ gravity model without oscillations in the effective dark   energy,"In this study, we propose a reparameterization of a specific viable $f(R)$ gravity model to represent it as a perturbation of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The $f(R)$ gravity model under consideration includes two parameters, $b$ and $n$, which control how close the proposed model can be to $\Lambda$CDM, allowing for arbitrary proximity. Furthermore, it is shown that the Hu-Sawicki (HS) model is a limiting case of this reparameterized model. Following the existing literature, we also derive an analytical approximation for the expansion rate $H(z)$, which shows an excellent agreement between this analytical approximation and the numerical solution over a wide range of redshifts for realistic values of the deviation parameter $b$. By appropriately selecting values for the model parameters, we plot the cosmological parameters $w_{\rm{DE}}$, $w_{\rm{eff}}$, $\Omega_{\rm{DE}}$, and $H(z)$, as well as the statefinder quantities $q$, $j$, $s$, and $Om(z)$. We find that their present values (at $z=0$) are consistent with the observations from Planck 2018 and the values predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model. It is important to note that the examined cosmological and statefinder parameters do not exhibit significant oscillations of effective dark energy, which could lead to singular and unphysical solutions at high redshifts. This anomalous behavior has been avoided here by utilizing the approximate analytical solution for $H(z)$.

1801.07265,Galaxy Bispectrum from Massive Spinning Particles,"Massive spinning particles, if present during inflation, lead to a distinctive bispectrum of primordial perturbations, the shape and amplitude of which depend on the masses and spins of the extra particles. This signal, in turn, leaves an imprint in the statistical distribution of galaxies; in particular, as a non-vanishing galaxy bispectrum, which can be used to probe the masses and spins of these particles. In this paper, we present for the first time a new theoretical template for the bispectrum generated by massive spinning particles, valid for a general triangle configuration. We then proceed to perform a Fisher-matrix forecast to assess the potential of two next-generation spectroscopic galaxy surveys, EUCLID and DESI, to constrain the primordial non-Gaussianity sourced by these extra particles. We model the galaxy bispectrum using tree-level perturbation theory, accounting for redshift-space distortions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect, and forecast constraints on the primordial non-Gaussianity parameters marginalizing over all relevant biases and cosmological parameters. Our results suggest that these surveys would potentially be sensitive to any primordial non-Gaussianity with an amplitude larger than $f_{\rm NL}\approx 1$, for massive particles with spins 2, 3, and 4.

Sphinx$^{20}$ is a full box cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation that simultaneously models the large-scale process of cosmic reionization and the detailed physics of a multiphase ISM, providing a statistical sample of galaxies akin to those currently being observed by JWST. The data set contains $\sim14,000$ mock images and spectra of the stellar continuum, nebular continuum, and 52 nebular emission lines, including Ly$\alpha$, for each galaxy in Sphinx$^{20}$ with a star formation rate $\geq0.3\ {\rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}}$. All galaxy emission has been processed with dust radiative transfer and/or resonant line radiative transfer, and data is provided for ten viewing angles for each galaxy. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive set of intrinsic galaxy properties, including halo masses, stellar masses, star formation histories, and ISM characteristics (e.g., metallicity, ISM gas densities, LyC escape fractions).

To check the accuracy with which we can recover the bubble parameters, we apply our method on mock observations appropriate for the upcoming SKA1-low.

2207.09414,"Batchelor, Saffman, and Kazantsev spectra in galactic small-scale   dynamos","The magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and probably also in the interstellar medium are believed to be generated by a small-scale dynamo. Theoretically, during its kinematic stage, it is characterized by a Kazantsev spectrum, which peaks at the resistive scale. It is only slightly shallower than the Saffman spectrum that is expected for random and causally connected magnetic fields. Causally disconnected fields have the even steeper Batchelor spectrum. Here we show that all three spectra are present in the small-scale dynamo. During the kinematic stage, the Batchelor spectrum occurs on scales larger than the energy-carrying scale of the turbulence, and the Kazantsev spectrum on smaller scales within the inertial range of the turbulence -- even for a magnetic Prandtl number of unity. In the saturated state, the dynamo develops a Saffman spectrum on large scales, suggestive of the build-up of long-range correlations. At large magnetic Prandtl numbers, elongated structures are seen in synthetic synchrotron emission maps showing the parity-even E polarization. We also observe a significant excess in the E polarization over the parity-odd B polarization at subresistive scales, and a deficiency at larger scales. This finding is at odds with the observed excess in the Galactic microwave foreground emission, which is believed to be associated with larger scales.

 The magnetic fields in galaxy clusters and probably also in the interstellar medium are believed to be generated by a small-scale dynamo. Theoretically, during its kinematic stage, it is characterized by a Kazantsev spectrum, which peaks at the resistive scale. It is only slightly shallower than the Saffman spectrum that is expected for random and causally connected magnetic fields. Causally disconnected fields have the even steeper Batchelor spectrum. Here we show that all three spectra are present in the small-scale dynamo. During the kinematic stage, the Batchelor spectrum occurs on scales larger than the energy-carrying scale of the turbulence, and the Kazantsev spectrum on smaller scales within the inertial range of the turbulence -- even for a magnetic Prandtl number of unity. In the saturated state, the dynamo develops a Saffman spectrum on large scales, suggestive of the build-up of long-range correlations. At large magnetic Prandtl numbers, elongated structures are seen in synthetic synchrotron emission maps showing the parity-even E polarization. We also observe a significant excess in the E polarization over the parity-odd B polarization at subresistive scales, and a deficiency at larger scales. This finding is at odds with the observed excess in the Galactic microwave foreground emission, which is believed to be associated with larger scales. The E and B polarizations may be highly non-Gaussian and skewed in the kinematic regime of the dynamo. For dust emission, however, the polarized emission is always nearly Gaussian, and the excess in the E polarization is much weaker."
1408.0955,The double formation of primordial black holes,"Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a useful tool in cosmology to probe primordial inhomogeneities on small scales that reenter the Hubble radius during the radiation dominated epoch.

One then expects the collapse of the central smaller region at the time of the crossing of this region, followed by another collapse of the larger perturbation at the time of its respective crossing. The smaller PBH, formed earlier, should be swallowed in the second collapse leading to a single larger PBH as the final state.

To facilitate the adequate subtraction of thermal dust, the instrument design of ECHO has included nine dust-dominated high-frequency bands over the frequency range of 220-850 GHz. In this work, we closely reexamine the utility of the high-frequency ECHO bands in foreground subtraction using the Needlet Internal Linear Combination component separation method. We consider three dust models: a physical dust model, a dust spectral energy distribution (SED) with a single modified black body (MBB) emission law and a multilayer dust model with frequency-frequency decorrelation. We consider eleven ECHO bands in the 28-190 GHz range as our baseline configuration and investigate the changes in the level foreground and noise residuals as subsequent dust-dominated high-frequency bands are added. We find that adding the high-frequency bands leads to a consistent decrease in the level of residual foreground and noise, and the sensitivity of r measurement improves.

Methods. The isolation status of each individual dark matter halo is determined by the distance to its nearest neighbour, which defines the maximum spherical region devoid of halos above a threshold mass around it (although the true size of such region may be much larger since it is not necessarily spherical). A versatile double power-law Schechter function is used to fit the dark matter halo AF, and its derived parameters are studied as a function of halo isolation status. Results. (a) Our function fits the halo abundances for all halo isolation statuses extremely well, while the well-established theoretical mass functions, integrated over the volume of the light-cone, provide an adequate but poorer fit than our phenomenological model. (b) As expected, and in agreement with other studies based on snap-shot simulations, we find significant differences of the halo abundance function as a function of halo isolation, indicating different rates of halo formation. The slope of the power law and the characteristic mass of the Schechter-like fitting function decrease with isolation, a result consistent with the formation of less massive haloes in lower density regions.

A large (~1200 km/s) velocity offset between the narrow and broad components of Hbeta has been measured in three different optical spectra from the VLT/VIMOS and Magellan/IMACS instruments. CID-42 is also the only X-ray source having in its X-ray spectra a strong redshifted broad absorption iron line, and an iron emission line, drawing an inverted P-Cygni profile.

The net result is that a stronger initial magnetic field produces more dramatic fluctuations in surface brightness and temperature, not the other way around.

Whether this tension is hinting towards new physics or some issue in the measurements, is still under debate; but it is clearly calling for new independent cosmological probes to provide additional pieces of evidence to solve this puzzle. This chapter introduces the method of cosmic chronometers, a new emerging cosmological probe that can provide cosmology-independent estimates of the Universe's expansion history.

This technique relies on splashback, a feature associated with the apocenter of recently accreted galaxies that offers a clear window into the phase-space structure of clusters without the use of velocity information. We carry out this dynamical measurement using the stacked satellite distribution around a sample of luminous red galaxies in the fourth data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey and validate our results using abundance-matching and lensing masses. To illustrate the power of this measurement, we combine dynamical and lensing mass estimates to robustly constrain scalar-tensor theories of gravity at cluster scales.

Galaxy alignment has been established as a potential probe for cosmological information, but the application of cluster alignments for these purposes remains unexplored. Clusters are observed to have a higher alignment amplitude than galaxies, but because galaxies are much more numerous, the trade-off in detectability between the two signals remains unclear. We present forecasts comparing cluster and galaxy alignments for two extragalactic survey set-ups: a currently-available low redshift survey (SDSS) and an upcoming higher redshift survey (LSST). For SDSS, we rely on the publicly available redMaPPer catalogue to describe the cluster sample. For LSST, we perform estimations of the expected number counts while we extrapolate the alignment measurements from SDSS. Clusters in SDSS have typically higher alignment signal-to-noise than galaxies. For LSST, the cluster alignment signals quickly wash out with redshift due to a relatively low number count and a decreasing alignment amplitude. Nevertheless, a potential strong-suit of clusters is in their interplay with weak lensing: intrinsic alignments can be more easily isolated for clusters than for galaxies.

We use Euclid-like galaxy mock catalogues, in which we anchor the photometric redshifts to the 3D galaxy distribution of the available spectroscopic redshifts. We then estimate the local density contrast by counting objects in cylindrical cells with radius from 1 to 10 h$^{-1}$Mpc over the redshift range 0.9<z<1.8.

The LOFAR data is consistent within the uncertainties with theoretical predictions of the correlation between the quasar fraction and linear size ratio, based on an orientation-based unification scheme."

Detecting relativistic Doppler shifts and gravitational effects in the rotation curves offers a tool for distinguishing between predictions of gravity theories that modify the inertia of particles and those that modify the field equations. These higher-order effects also allow us in principle, to test whether dark matter particles obey the equivalence principle. We calculate here the magnitudes of the relativistic Doppler and gravitational shifts expected in realistic models of galaxies in a general metric theory of gravity.

Some analyzes suggest the particles' injection spectrum at source to be as steep as -2.4 to -2.7, making the problem much worse, by a factor of order 10^6. Nevertheless, it seems implausible that more than at the very best 1/3 of the jet energy, goes into the required flux of energetic particles thus, one would need to allow for the possibility that there is an energy problem, which we would like to address in this work. Sequences of consecutive oblique shock features, or conical shocks, have been theorized and eventually observed in many AGN jets.

We find hints for a $3\sigma$ level mismatch between the low and high galactic distance parameter values. We then use AIC and BIC criteria to compare and rank the following types of models: Base models: Universal values for $R_W$ and $M_H^{W}$ (no parameter variation), I Individual fitted galactic $R_W$ with a universal fitted $M_H^{W}$, II Universal fixed $R_W$ with individual fitted galactic $M_H^{W}$, III Universal fitted $R_W$ with individual fitted galactic $M_H^{W}$, IV Two universal fitted $R_W$ (near and far) with one universal fitted $M_H^{W}$, V Universal fitted $R_W$ with two universal fitted $M_H^{W}$ (near and far), VI Two universal fitted $R_W$ with two universal fitted $M_H^{W}$ (near and far).

We then use AIC and BIC criteria to compare and rank the following types of models: Base models: Universal values for $R_W$ and $M_H^{W}$ (no parameter variation), I Individual fitted galactic $R_W$ with a universal fitted $M_H^{W}$, II Universal fixed $R_W$ with individual fitted galactic $M_H^{W}$, III Universal fitted $R_W$ with individual fitted galactic $M_H^{W}$, IV Two universal fitted $R_W$ (near and far) with one universal fitted $M_H^{W}$, V Universal fitted $R_W$ with two universal fitted $M_H^{W}$ (near and far), VI Two universal fitted $R_W$ with two universal fitted $M_H^{W}$ (near and far). We find that the AIC and BIC criteria consistently favor model IV instead of the commonly used Base model where no variation is allowed for the Cepheid empirical parameters. The best fit value of the SnIa absolute magnitude $M_B$ and of $H_0$ implied by the favored model IV is consistent with the inverse distance ladder calibration based on the CMB sound horizon $H_0=67.4\pm 0.5\,km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$. Thus in the context of the favored model IV the Hubble crisis is not present. This model may imply the presence of a fundamental physics transition taking place at a time more recent than $100\,Myrs$ ago."

The data were obtained in the best available seeing at UKIRT and Gemini North, with integration times scaled to ensure that comparable rest-frame surface brightness levels are reached for all galaxies. We fit two-dimensional axi-symmetric galaxy models to determine galaxy morphologies at rest-frame optical wavelengths > 4000A, varying luminosity, axial ratio, half-light radius, and Sersic index. We find that, while some images show evidence of galaxy interactions, >95% of the rest-frame optical light in all galaxies is well-described by these simple models. We also find a clear difference in morphology between these two classes of galaxy; fits to the individual images and image stacks reveal that the radio galaxies are moderately large (<r{1/2}>=8.4+-1.1kpc; median r{1/2}=7.8), de Vaucouleurs spheroids (<n> = 4.07+-0.27; median n=3.87), while the sub-mm galaxies appear to be moderately compact (<r{1/2}>=3.4+-0.3kpc; median r{1/2}=3.1kpc) exponential discs (<n>=1.44+-0.16; median n=1.08).

2208.02800,Boltzmann equations for astrophysical Stochastic Gravitational Wave   Backgrounds scattering off of massive objects,"This work presents a set of coupled Boltzmann equations describing the intensity and polarisation Stokes parameters of the SGWB. Collision terms, which account for gravitational Compton scattering off of massive objects, are also included. This set resembles that for the CMB Stokes parameters, but the different spin nature of the gravitational radiation and the physics involved in the scattering process determine crucial differences. In this case, due to the Rutherford angular dependence of the cross section, all the SGWB intensity multipoles of order $\ell$ are scattered out, producing outgoing intensity anisotropies of any order $\ell$ if they are present in the incoming radiation. On the other hand, SGWB linear polarisation modes can be expanded in a basis of spherical harmonics with $m=\pm 4$ and $\ell\ge 4$. This means that SGWB polarisation modes can be generated from unpolarised anisotropic radiation only with $m=\pm 4$, therefore requiring at least a hexadecapole anisotropy ($\ell\ge 4$) in the incoming intensity. Assuming a simplified toy model, we solve analytically the set of coupled Boltzmann equations to get explicit expressions for the intensity and polarisation angular power spectra. We confirm the contribution of the gravitational Compton scattering to the SGWB anisoptropies is extremely small for collisions with compact objects in the frequency range of current and upcoming surveys. The system of coupled Boltzmann equations presented here provides a way to an accurate estimate of the total amount of anisotropies generated by multiple SGWB scattering processes off of massive objects, as well as the interplay between polarisation and intensity, during the GW propagation across the LSS of the universe.

Using rest-frame optical photometry, we investigate evolution in the color and scatter of the red sequence galaxy population, comparing with models of possible star formation histories. In contrast to studies of central cluster galaxies at lower redshift (z < 1), these data are clearly inconsistent with the continued evolution of stars formed and assembled primarily at a single, much-earlier time. Specifically, we find that the colors of massive cluster galaxies at z = 1.5 imply that the bulk of star formation occurred at z ~ 3, whereas by z = 1 their colors imply formation at z ~ 2; therefore these galaxies exhibit approximately the same luminosity-weighted stellar age at 1 < z < 1.5.

Aims: Giant clumps are orbiting in the same direction in a premature disk and so massive that they may be expected to interact gravitationally with halo objects and exercise influence on kinematic state of the halo. Accordingly, I scrutinize the possibility that the clumps leave a kinematic imprint of the clumpy disk formation on a halo system. Methods: I perform a restricted N-body calculation with a toy-model to study the kinematic influence on a halo by orbital motions of clumps, examine dependence of the results on masses (mass-loss), number and orbital radii of the clumps. Results: I will show that halo objects can catch clump motions and acquire disky rotation in a dynamical friction time-scale of the clumps, ~0.5 Gyr.

Our results show that a non-zero time dependent bulk viscosity in the universe sector is strongly preferred by the current cosmological probes and will possibly be confirmed at many standard deviations by the future GWSS measurements. We further mention that the addition of GWSS data can significantly reduce the uncertainties of the key cosmological parameters obtained from the usual cosmological probes employed in this work."
1811.06546,Neutron Star Stability in Light of the Neutron Decay Anomaly,A recent proposal suggests that experimental discrepancies on the lifetime of neutrons can be resolved if neutrons decay to dark matter. At the same time it has been demonstrated that such a decay mode would soften the nuclear equation of state resulting in neutron stars with a maximum mass much below currently observed ones. In this paper we demonstrate that appropriate dark matter-baryon interactions can accommodate neutron stars with mass above 2 solar masses. We also show that dark matter self-interactions could also help neutrons stars reach 2 solar masses provided that dark matter is of asymmetric nature.,hep-ph astro-ph.CO,"High Energy Physics - Phenomenology, Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Neutron Star Stability in Light of the Neutron Decay Anomaly

1311.1164,Testing No-Scale Supergravity with the Fermi Space Telescope LAT,"We describe a methodology for testing No-Scale Supergravity by the LAT instrument onboard the Fermi Space Telescope via observation of gamma ray emissions from lightest supersymmetric (SUSY) neutralino annihilations. For our test vehicle we engage the framework of the supersymmetric grand unified model No-Scale Flipped $SU(5)$ with extra vector-like flippon multiplets derived from F-Theory, known as $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$. We show that through compression of the light stau and light bino neutralino mass difference, where internal bremsstrahlung (IB) photons give a dominant contribution, the photon yield from annihilation of SUSY dark matter can be elevated to a number of events potentially observable by the Fermi-LAT in the coming years. Likewise, the increased yield in No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$ may also have rendered the existing observation of a 133 GeV monochromatic gamma ray line visible, if additional data should exclude systematic or statistical explanations. The question of intensity aside, No-Scale $\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$ can indeed provide a natural weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) candidate with a mass in the correct range to yield $\gamma \gamma$ and $\gamma Z$ emission lines at $m_{\chi} \sim 133$ GeV and $m_{\chi} \sim 145$ GeV, respectively.

The sample is selected to capture the whole gamut of assembly histories that produce clusters of similar final mass. We present an overview of the successes and shortcomings of such simulations in reproducing both the stellar properties of galaxies as well as properties of the hot plasma in clusters. In our simulations, a long-lived cool-core/non-cool core dichotomy arises naturally, and the emergence of non-cool cores is related to low angular momentum major mergers.

Stars are produced at an efficiency consistent with abundance matching constraints and central galaxies have star formation rates consistent with recent observations.

In particular shapes of some of them are contrastingly different from the known shapes of the caustics formed in the Zeldovich approximation."

1707.06172,Search for CII Emission on Cosmological Scales at Redshift Z~2.6,"We present a search for CII emission over cosmological scales at high-redshifts. The CII line is a prime candidate to be a tracer of star formation over large-scale structure since it is one of the brightest emission lines from galaxies. Redshifted CII emission appears in the submillimeter regime, meaning it could potentially be present in the higher frequency intensity data from the Planck satellite used to measure the cosmic infrared background (CIB). We search for CII emission over redshifts z=2-3.2 in the Planck 545 GHz intensity map by cross-correlating the 3 highest frequency Planck maps with spectroscopic quasars and CMASS galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), which we then use to jointly fit for CII intensity, CIB parameters, and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) emission. We report a measurement of an anomalous emission $\mathrm{I_\nu}=6.6^{+5.0}_{-4.8}\times10^4$ Jy/sr at 95% confidence, which could be explained by CII emission, favoring collisional excitation models of CII emission that tend to be more optimistic than models based on CII luminosity scaling relations from local measurements; however, a comparison of Bayesian information criteria reveal that this model and the CIB & SZ only model are equally plausible. Thus, more sensitive measurements will be needed to confirm the existence of large-scale CII emission at high redshifts. Finally, we forecast that intensity maps from Planck cross-correlated with quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) would increase our sensitivity to CII emission by a factor of 5, while the proposed Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) could increase the sensitivity further.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Search for CII Emission on Cosmological Scales at Redshift Z~2.6

Redshifted CII emission appears in the submillimeter regime, meaning it could potentially be present in the higher frequency intensity data from the Planck satellite used to measure the cosmic infrared background (CIB). We search for CII emission over redshifts z=2-3.2 in the Planck 545 GHz intensity map by cross-correlating the 3 highest frequency Planck maps with spectroscopic quasars and CMASS galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III), which we then use to jointly fit for CII intensity, CIB parameters, and thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) emission. We report a measurement of an anomalous emission $\mathrm{I_\nu}=6.6^{+5.0}_{-4.8}\times10^4$ Jy/sr at 95% confidence, which could be explained by CII emission, favoring collisional excitation models of CII emission that tend to be more optimistic than models based on CII luminosity scaling relations from local measurements; however, a comparison of Bayesian information criteria reveal that this model and the CIB & SZ only model are equally plausible. Thus, more sensitive measurements will be needed to confirm the existence of large-scale CII emission at high redshifts. Finally, we forecast that intensity maps from Planck cross-correlated with quasars from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) would increase our sensitivity to CII emission by a factor of 5, while the proposed Primordial Inflation Explorer (PIXIE) could increase the sensitivity further."
1706.09906,Halo assembly bias and the tidal anisotropy of the local halo   environment,"We study the role of the local tidal environment in determining the assembly bias of dark matter haloes. Previous results suggest that the anisotropy of a halo's environment (i.e, whether it lies in a filament or in a more isotropic region) can play a significant role in determining the eventual mass and age of the halo. We statistically isolate this effect using correlations between the large-scale and small-scale environments of simulated haloes at $z=0$ with masses between $10^{11.6}\lesssim (m/h^{-1}M_{\odot})\lesssim10^{14.9}$. We probe the large-scale environment using a novel halo-by-halo estimator of linear bias. For the small-scale environment, we identify a variable $\alpha_R$ that captures the $\textit{tidal anisotropy}$ in a region of radius $R=4R_{\textrm{200b}}$ around the halo and correlates strongly with halo bias at fixed mass. Segregating haloes by $\alpha_R$ reveals two distinct populations. Haloes in highly isotropic local environments ($\alpha_R\lesssim0.2$) behave as expected from the simplest, spherically averaged analytical models of structure formation, showing a $\textit{negative}$ correlation between their concentration and large-scale bias at $\textit{all}$ masses. In contrast, haloes in anisotropic, filament-like environments ($\alpha_R\gtrsim0.5$) tend to show a $\textit{positive}$ correlation between bias and concentration at any mass. Our multi-scale analysis cleanly demonstrates how the overall assembly bias trend across halo mass emerges as an average over these different halo populations, and provides valuable insights towards building analytical models that correctly incorporate assembly bias.

1311.5230,The stellar mass function and efficiency of galaxy formation with a   varying initial mass function,"Several recent observational studies have concluded that the initial mass function (IMF) of stars varies systematically with galaxy properties such as velocity dispersion. In this paper, we investigate the effect of linking the circular velocity of galaxies, as determined from the Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations, to the slope of the IMF with parameterizations guided by several of these studies. For each empirical relation, we generate stellar masses of ~600,000 SDSS galaxies at z ~ 0.1, by fitting the optical photometry to large suites of synthetic stellar populations that sample the full range of galaxy parameters. We generate stellar mass functions and examine the stellar-to-halo mass relations using sub-halo abundance matching. At the massive end, the stellar mass functions become a power law, instead of the familiar exponential decline. As a result, it is a generic feature of these models that the central galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation is significantly flatter at high masses (slope ~ -0.3 to -0.4) than in the case of a universal IMF (slope ~ -0.6). We find that regardless of whether the IMF varies systematically in all galaxies or just early types, there is still a well-defined peak in the central stellar-to-halo mass ratio at halo masses of ~ 10E12 solar masses. In general, the IMF variations explored here lead to significantly higher integrated stellar densities if the assumed dependence on circular velocity applies to all galaxies, including late-types; in fact the more extreme cases can be ruled out, as they imply an unphysical situation in which the stellar fraction exceeds the universal baryon fraction.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"The stellar mass function and efficiency of galaxy formation with a   varying initial mass function

In this article, we review the main known theoretical results on average distance measures in cosmology, based on second-order perturbation theory, and we fill in some of their gaps. We then comprehensively test these theoretical predictions against ray tracing in a high-resolution dark-matter $N$-body simulation. This method allows us to describe the effect of small-scale inhomogeneities deep into the non-linear regime of structure formation on light propagation up to $z=10$. We find that numerical results are in remarkably good agreement with theoretical predictions in the limit of super-sample variance. No unexpectedly large bias originates from very small scales, whose effect is fully encoded in the non-linear power spectrum. Specifically, the directional average of the inverse amplification and the source-averaged amplification are compatible with unity; the change in area of surfaces of constant cosmic time is compatible with zero; the biases on other distance measures, which can reach slightly less than $1\%$ at high redshift, are well understood.

1611.01914,A jet-driven dynamo (JEDD) from jets-inflated bubbles in cooling flows,"I suggest that the main process that amplifies magnetic fields in cooling flows in clusters and group of galaxies is a jet-driven dynamo (JEDD). The main processes that are behind the JEDD is the turbulence that is formed by the many vortices formed in the inflation processes of bubbles, and the large scale shear formed by the propagating jet. It is sufficient that a strong turbulence exits in the vicinity of the jets and bubbles, just where the shear is large. The typical amplification time of magnetic fields by the JEDD near the jets and bubbles is approximately hundred million years. The amplification time in the entire cooling flow region is somewhat longer. The vortices that create the turbulence are those that also transfer energy from the jets to the intra-cluster medium, by mixing shocked jet gas with the intra-cluster medium gas, and by exciting sound waves.

The results suggest that the models are generally in agreement with the reconstructed potential within a $3\sigma$ confidence interval, except in the case of Observational H(z) data (OHD) with the Planck 18 (P18) prior.

1002.4122,A sub-resolution multiphase interstellar medium model of star formation   and SNe energy feedback,"We present a new multi-phase sub-resolution model for star formation and feedback in SPH numerical simulations of galaxy formation. Our model, called MUPPI (MUlti-Phase Particle Integrator), describes each gas particle as a multi-phase system, with cold and hot gas phases, coexisting in pressure equilibrium, and a stellar component. Cooling of the hot tenuous gas phase feeds the cold gas phase. Stars are formed out of molecular gas with a given efficiency, which scales with the dynamical time of the cold phase. Our prescription for star formation is not based on imposing the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation, which is instead naturally produced by MUPPI. Energy from supernova explosions is deposited partly into the hot phase of the gas particles, and partly to that of neighboring particles. Mass and energy flows among the different phases of each particle are described by a set of ordinary differential equations which we explicitly integrate for each gas particle, instead of relying on equilibrium solutions. This system of equations also includes the response of the multi-phase structure to energy changes associated to the thermodynamics of the gas. We apply our model to two isolated disk galaxy simulations and two spherical cooling flows. MUPPI is able to reproduce the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for disc galaxies. It also reproduces the basic properties of the inter-stellar medium in disc galaxies, the surface densities of cold and molecular gas, of stars and of star formation rate, the vertical velocity dispersion of cold clouds and the flows connected to the galactic fountains.

We make use of optical spectra and UV-to-NIR imaging of the dwarf sample to derive SFRs, stellar masses, ages and metallicities - which are further supplemented with structural parameters that are used to classify them morphologically. This dataset, coupled with a detailed characterisation of each dwarf's environment, allows for a fully comprehensive investigation of their origins and to track the potential evolutionary paths between the different dwarf types. We characterise the local environment of all dwarfs in our sample, paying special attention to trends with current star formation activity. We find that virtually all quiescent dwarfs are located in the vicinity (projected distances < 1.5 Mpc) of L* companions, consistent with recent results. While star-forming dwarfs are preferentially found at separations of the order of 1 Mpc, there appears to be a tail towards low separations (<100 kpc) in the distribution of projected distances. We speculate that, modulo projection effects, this probably represents a genuine population of late-type dwarfs caught upon first infall about their host and before environmental quenching has fully operated. In this context, these results suggest that internal mechanisms -such as gas exhaustion via star formation or feedback effects- are not sufficient to completely cease the star formation activity in dwarf galaxies, and that becoming the satellite of a massive central galaxy appears to be a necessary condition to create a quiescent dwarf.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"A Virtual Observatory Census to Address Dwarfs Origins.

In the paper we analyze a potential to reduce upper bounds for graviton mass with future observational data on trajectories of bright stars near the Galactic Center. Since gravitational potentials are different for these two cases, expressions for relativistic advance for general relativity and Yukawa potential are different functions on eccentricity and semimajor axis, it gives an opportunity to improve current estimates of graviton mass with future observational facilities. In our considerations of an improvement potential for a graviton mass estimate we adopt a conservative strategy and assume that trajectories of bright stars and their apocenter advance will be described with general relativity expressions and it gives opportunities to improve graviton mass constraints. In contrast with our previous studies, where we present current constraints on parameters of Yukawa gravity (Borka et al., 2013) and graviton mass (Zakharov et al., 2016) from observations of S2 star, in the paper we express expectations to improve current constraints for graviton mass, assuming the GR predictions about apocenter shifts will be confirmed with future observations.

Since gravitational potentials are different for these two cases, expressions for relativistic advance for general relativity and Yukawa potential are different functions on eccentricity and semimajor axis, it gives an opportunity to improve current estimates of graviton mass with future observational facilities. In our considerations of an improvement potential for a graviton mass estimate we adopt a conservative strategy and assume that trajectories of bright stars and their apocenter advance will be described with general relativity expressions and it gives opportunities to improve graviton mass constraints. In contrast with our previous studies, where we present current constraints on parameters of Yukawa gravity (Borka et al., 2013) and graviton mass (Zakharov et al., 2016) from observations of S2 star, in the paper we express expectations to improve current constraints for graviton mass, assuming the GR predictions about apocenter shifts will be confirmed with future observations. We concluded that if future observations of bright star orbits during around fifty years will confirm GR predictions about apocenter shifts of bright star orbits it give an opportunity to constrain a graviton mass at a level around $5 \times 10^{-23}$ eV or slightly better than current estimates obtained with LIGO observations."
1210.3338,Some results on the radio-SZ correlation for galaxy cluster radio halos,"We present correlation results for the radio halo power in galaxy clusters with the integrated thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signal, including new results obtained at sub-GHz frequencies. The radio data is compiled from several published works, and the SZ measurements are taken from the Planck ESZ cluster catalog. The tight correlation between the radio halo power and the SZ effect demonstrates a clear correspondence between the thermal and non-thermal electron populations in the intra-cluster medium, as already has been shown in X-ray based studies. The radio power varies roughly as the square of the global SZ signal, but when the SZ signal is scaled to within the radio halo radius the correlation becomes approximately linear, with reduced intrinsic scatter. We do not find any strong indication of a bi-modal division in the radio halo cluster population, as has been reported in the literature, which suggests that such duality could be an artifact of X-ray selection. We compare the SZ signal dependence of radio halos with simplified predictions from theoretical models, and discuss some implications and shortcomings of the present work.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Some results on the radio-SZ correlation for galaxy cluster radio halos

The novel aspect of this scheme is that the metric potentials are solved for analytically in the Eulerian frame. The evolution is assumed to follow GR at very early epochs and switches to $f(R)$ at a pre-determined epoch.

To make an informed choice, we perform an eigenvalue analysis of the background model which gives a ballpark estimate of the magnitude of oscillations. There are two length scales in the problem: the comoving Compton wavelength of the associated scalar field and the width of the top-hat. The evolution is determined by their ratio. When the ratio is large, the evolution is scale-independent and the density-velocity divergence relation (DVDR) is unique. When the ratio is small, the evolution is very close to GR, except for the formation of a spike near the top-hat edge, a feature which has been noted in earlier literature.

2011.00116,"Dynamical friction in Bose-Einstein condensed self-interacting dark   matter at finite temperatures, and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal","The aim of the present work is to better understand the gravitational drag forces, i.e. dynamical friction, acting on massive objects moving through a self-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate, also known as a superfluid, at finite temperatures. This is relevant for light scalar models of dark matter with weak self-interactions that require nonzero temperatures, or that have been heated inside galaxies. We derived expressions for dynamical friction using linear perturbation theory, and compared these to numerical simulations in which nonlinear effects are included. After testing the linear result, it was applied to the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and two of its gravitationally bound globular clusters. Dwarf spheroidals are well-suited for indirectly probing properties of dark matter, and so by estimating the rate at which these globular clusters are expected to sink into their host halo due to dynamical friction, we inferred limits on the superfluid dark matter parameter space. The dynamical friction in a finite-temperature superfluid is found to behave very similarly to the zero-temperature limit, even when the thermal contributions are large. However, when a critical velocity for the superfluid flow is included, the friction force can transition from the zero-temperature value to the value in a conventional fluid. Increasing the mass of the perturbing object induces a similar transition to when lowering the critical velocity. When applied to two of Fornax's globular clusters, we find that the parameter space preferred in the literature for a zero-temperature superfluid yields decay times that are in agreement with observations. However, the present work suggests that increasing the temperature, which is expected to change the preferred parameter space, may lead to very small decay times, and therefore pose a problem for finite-temperature superfluid models of dark matter.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Dynamical friction in Bose-Einstein condensed self-interacting dark   matter at finite temperatures, and the Fornax dwarf spheroidal

We use principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the CVC shapes to find characteristic features and use a $k$-means classifier to separate circular curves into classes. This objective classification method identifies four different classes, which we name slow-rising (SR), flat (FL), round-peaked (RP) and sharp-peaked (SP) circular curves.   SR are typical for low-mass, late-type (Sb-Sdm), young, faint, metal-poor and disc-dominated galaxies.

Additionally, we complement the multi-wavelength coverage of the galaxies located in the GOODS fields with deep FIR data taken from the GOODS-Herschel project. We find that sBzK galaxies represent the general population of SF galaxies at z ~ 2 better than LBGs. For a given stellar mass, LBGs tend to have bluer optical colours than sBzK and UV-selected galaxies. We find clean PACS individual detections for a subsample of 48 LBGs, 89 sBzK, and 91 UV-selected galaxies, that measure their dust emission directly. Their SFR_total = SFR_UV + SFR_IR cannot be recovered with the dust-correction factors derived with their continuum slope and the IRX-beta relations for local starbursts. This has implications, for example, in the definition of the main sequence (MS) at z ~ 2. PACS-detected galaxies are located above the z ~ 2 MS and thus their star formation is probably driven by starburst. This is in agreement with the shape of their IR SEDs. PACS-detected galaxies with redder UV continuum slope and higher stellar mass are more attenuated. We find that for a given UV continuum slope the dustiest galaxies at higher redshifts are more attenuated and that for a given stellar mass the dustiest galaxies at higher redshifts have stronger FIR emission. This suggests an evolution of their dust properties. However, we do not find significant evolution in the relation between dust attenuation and stellar mass with redshift, at least at z < 2.5. There is a subpopulation of 17, 26, and 27 LBGs, sBzK, and UV-selected galaxies, respectively, that are detected in any of the SPIRE bands.

The presence of substructures and non-Gaussian redshift distributions indicate that the cluster system is dynamically young and not in a virialized state. We find evidence for two important galaxy populations. \textit{Morphologically distorted galaxies} are probably subject to increased tidal interactions. They show pronounced rotation curve asymmetries at intermediate cluster-centric radii and low rest-frame peculiar velocities. \textit{Morphologically undistorted galaxies} show the strongest rotation curve asymmetries at high rest-frame velocities and low cluster-centric radii. Supposedly, this group is strongly affected by ram-pressure stripping due to interaction with the intra-cluster medium. Among the morphologically undistorted galaxies, dusty red galaxies have particularly strong rotation curve asymmetries, suggesting ram pressure is an important factor in these galaxies. Furthermore, dusty red galaxies on average have a bulge-to-total ratio higher by a factor of two than cluster blue cloud and field galaxies. The fraction of kinematically distorted galaxies is 75% higher in the cluster than in the field environment. This difference mainly stems from morphological undistorted galaxies, indicating a cluster-specific interaction process that only affects the gas kinematics but not the stellar morphology. Also the ratio between gas and stellar scale length is reduced for cluster galaxies compared to the field sample.

Our QSO candidate sample lists 1476 sources with $i < 18$ over 12,400 square degrees in the southern hemisphere. With a preliminary campaign we observed spectroscopically 70 of them, confirming 56 new bright QSOs at $z > 2.5$, corresponding to a success rate of our method of $\sim$ 80\%. Furthermore, we estimate a completeness of $\sim$ 90\% of our sample at completion of our observation campaign. The new QSOs confirmed by this first and the forthcoming campaigns will be the targets of subsequent studies using higher resolution spectrographs, like ESPRESSO, UVES, and (in the long term) ELT/HIRES."

To mitigate the effects of RFI on data analysis pipelines, numerous inpaint techniques have been developed to restore RFI corrupted data.

We perform our analysis on simulated data as well as real data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) Phase 1 upper limits. We also introduce a convolutional neural network that capable of inpainting RFI corrupted data in interferometric instruments. We train our network on simulated data and show that our network is capable at inpainting real data without requiring to be retrained. We find that techniques that incorporate high wavenumbers in delay space in their modeling are best suited for inpainting over narrowband RFI. We also show that with our fiducial parameters Discrete Prolate Spheroidal Sequences (DPSS) and CLEAN provide the best performance for intermittent ``narrowband'' RFI while Gaussian Progress Regression (GPR) and Least Squares Spectral Analysis (LSSA) provide the best performance for larger RFI gaps. However we caution that these qualitative conclusions are sensitive to the chosen hyperparameters of each inpainting technique. We find these results to be consistent in both simulated and real visibilities. We show that all inpainting techniques reliably reproduce foreground dominated modes in the power spectrum. Since the inpainting techniques should not be capable of reproducing noise realizations, we find that the largest errors occur in the noise dominated delay modes.

This relationship does not require for the velocity dispersion measurement, and hence can avoid major uncertainties. By using this relationship, the multimessenger approach is able to distinguish an $8\%$ MG effect. Our results show that the GW multimessenger approach can play an important role in revealing the nature of gravity on the galactic and extra-galactic scales."
0910.1813,Jet opening angles and gamma-ray brightness of AGN,"We have investigated the differences in apparent opening angles between the parsec-scale jets of the active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) during its first three months of operations and those of non-LAT-detected AGN. We used 15.4 GHz VLBA observations of sources from the 2 cm VLBA MOJAVE program, a subset of which comprise the statistically complete flux density limited MOJAVE sample. We determined the apparent opening angles by analyzing transverse jet profiles from the data in the image plane and by applying a model fitting technique to the data in the (u,v) plane. Both methods provided comparable opening angle estimates. The apparent opening angles of gamma-ray bright blazars are preferentially larger than those of gamma-ray weak sources. At the same time, we have found the two groups to have similar intrinsic opening angle distributions, based on a smaller subset of sources. This suggests that the jets in gamma-ray bright AGN are oriented at preferentially smaller angles to the line of sight resulting in a stronger relativistic beaming. The intrinsic jet opening angle and bulk flow Lorentz factor are found to be inversely proportional, as predicted by standard models of compact relativistic jets. If a gas dynamical jet acceleration model is assumed, the ratio of the initial pressure of the plasma in the core region P_0 to the external pressure P_ext lies within the range 1.1 to 34.6, with a best fit estimate of P_0/P_ext=2.",astro-ph.CO,Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics,"Jet opening angles and gamma-ray brightness of AGN

1206.1855,The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and galactic outflows,"Most of the baryons in the Universe are not in the form of stars and cold gas in galaxies. Galactic outflows driven by supernovae/stellar winds are the leading mechanism for explaining this fact. The scaling relation between galaxy mass and outer rotation velocity (also known as the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation, BTF) has recently been used as evidence against this viewpoint. We use a LCDM based semi-analytic disk galaxy formation model to investigate these claims. In our model, galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher gas fractions are more efficient at ejecting gas from galaxies. This is due to the fact that galaxies with less efficient star formation and higher gas fractions tend to live in dark matter haloes with lower circular velocities, from which less energy is required to escape the potential well. In our model the intrinsic scatter in the BTF is 0.15 dex, and mostly reflects scatter in dark halo concentration. The observed scatter, equal to 0.24 dex, is dominated by measurement errors. The best estimate for the intrinsic scatter is that it is less than 0.15 dex, and thus our LCDM based model (which does not include all possible sources of scatter) is only just consistent with this. In our model, gas rich galaxies, at fixed virial velocity (V_vir), with lower stellar masses have lower baryonic masses. This is consistent with the expectation that galaxies with lower stellar masses have had less energy available to drive an outflow. However, when the outer rotation velocity (V_flat) is used the correlation has the opposite sign, with a slope in agreement with observations. This is due to scatter in the relation between V_flat and V_vir. In summary, contrary to some previous claims, we show that basic features of the BTF are consistent with a LCDM based model in which the low efficiency of galaxy formation is determined by galactic outflows.",astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA,"Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics, Astrophysics of Galaxies","The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation and galactic outflows

1409.6698,Disorder in the Early Universe,"Little is known about the microscopic physics that gave rise to inflation in our universe. There are many reasons to wonder if the underlying description requires a careful arrangement of ingredients or if inflation was the result of an essentially random process. At a technical level, randomness in the microphysics of inflation is closely related to disorder in solids. We develop the formalism of disorder for inflation and investigate the observational consequences of quenched disorder.

 Little is known about the microscopic physics that gave rise to inflation in our universe. There are many reasons to wonder if the underlying description requires a careful arrangement of ingredients or if inflation was the result of an essentially random process. At a technical level, randomness in the microphysics of inflation is closely related to disorder in solids. We develop the formalism of disorder for inflation and investigate the observational consequences of quenched disorder.

1904.12310,Screened fifth forces in parity-breaking correlation functions,"Cross-correlating two different types of galaxy gives rise to parity breaking in the correlation function that derives from differences in the galaxies' properties and environments. This is typically associated with a difference in galaxy bias, describing the relation between galaxy number density and dark matter density, although observational effects such as magnification bias also play a role. In this paper we show that the presence of a screened fifth force adds additional degrees of freedom to the correlation function, describing the effective coupling of the force to the two galaxy populations. These are also properties of the galaxies' environments, but with different dependence in general to galaxy bias. We derive the parity-breaking correlation function analytically as a function of fifth-force strength and the two populations' fifth-force charges, and explore the result numerically using Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ as a toy model of chameleon screening. We find that screening gives rise to an octopole, which, in the absence of magnification bias, is not present in any gravity theory without screening and thus is a qualitatively distinct signature. The modification to the dipole and octopole can be $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ and $\mathcal{O}(100\%)$ respectively at redshift $z \gtrsim 0.5$ due to screening, but decreases towards lower redshift. The change in the background power spectrum in $f(R)$ theories induces a change in the dipole of roughly the same size, but dominant to the effect of screening at low $z$.

The code is then used to simulate the formation of a galaxy cluster with a simple primordial magnetic field embedded in the gas. A homogeneous seed field of 10^-11 G is amplified by a factor of 10^3 during the formation of the cluster. The results show good agreement with the profiles found in other magnetic cluster simulations of similar resolution."

As a first step, we compute the dynamical friction force experienced by bodies moving in a circular orbit.

In this paper, we revisit this data vector and examine its stability under different cosmological models. We find that the CMB distance priors are an accurate substitute for the full CMB data when probing dark energy dynamics. This is true when the primordial power spectrum model is directly generalized from the power spectrum of the model used in the derivation of the distance priors from the CMB data. We discover a difference when a non-flat model with the untilted primordial inflation power spectrum is used to measure the distance priors. This power spectrum is a radical change from the more conventional tilted primordial power spectrum and violates fundamental assumptions for the reliability of the CMB shift parameters. We also investigate the performance of CMB distance priors when the sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_{\nu}$ and the effective number of relativistic species $N_{\text{eff}}$ are allowed to vary. Our findings are consistent with earlier results: the neutrino parameters can change the measurement of the sound horizon from CMB data, and thus the CMB distance priors. We find that when the neutrino model is allowed to vary, the cold dark matter density $\omega_{c}$ and $N_{\text{eff}}$ need to be included in the set of parameters that summarize CMB data, in order to reproduce the constraints from the full CMB data.

Here we analyze recently reported observations of iPTF13bvn, which could possibly be the first detection of a SN Ib progenitor based on pre-explosion images. Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models of single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor candidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming a recently proposed scenario. We find that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the observed photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn.

0902.1531,Is the Milky Way ringing? The hunt for high velocity streams,"We perform numerical simulations of a stellar galactic disk with initial conditions chosen to represent an unrelaxed population which might have been left following a merger. Stars are unevenly distributed in radial action angle, though the disk is axisymmetric. The velocity distribution in the simulated Solar neighborhood exhibits waves traveling in the direction of positive v, where u,v are the radial and tangential velocity components. As the system relaxes and structure wraps in phase space, the features seen in the uv-plane move closer together. We show that these results can be obtained also by a semi-analytical method.

The hunt for high velocity streams 
 We perform numerical simulations of a stellar galactic disk with initial conditions chosen to represent an unrelaxed population which might have been left following a merger. Stars are unevenly distributed in radial action angle, though the disk is axisymmetric. The velocity distribution in the simulated Solar neighborhood exhibits waves traveling in the direction of positive v, where u,v are the radial and tangential velocity components. As the system relaxes and structure wraps in phase space, the features seen in the uv-plane move closer together. We show that these results can be obtained also by a semi-analytical method.

2104.10937,Recovering 21-cm signal from simulated FAST intensity maps,"The 21-cm intensity mapping (IM) of neutral hydrogen (HI) is a promising tool to probe the large-scale structures. Sky maps of 21-cm intensities can be highly contaminated by different foregrounds, such as Galactic synchrotron radiation, free-free emission, extragalactic point sources, and atmospheric noise. We here present a model of foreground components and a method of removal, especially to quantify the potential of Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) for measuring HI IM. We consider 1-year observational time with the survey area of $20,000\,{\rm deg}^{2}$ to capture significant variations of the foregrounds across both the sky position and angular scales relative to the HI signal. We first simulate the observational sky and then employ the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) foreground separation technique. We show that by including different foregrounds, thermal and $1/f$ noises, the value of the standard deviation between reconstructed 21-cm IM map and the input pure 21-cm signal is $\Delta T = 0.034\,{\rm mK}$, which is well under control. The eigenmode-based analysis shows that the underlying HI eigenmode is just less than $1$ per cent level of the total sky components.

The statistics we focus on are also suitable to deal with spherical random fields which can only be partially observed, the canonical example being provided by the masking effect of the Milky Way on Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation data."

According to the earlier suggestion by Yahata et al. (2007), we consider how far-infrared (FIR) emission of galaxies affects the SFD map. We first compute the surface number density of SDSS DR7 galaxies as a function of the $r$-band extinction, $A_{r,\rm SFD}$. We confirm that the surface densities of those galaxies positively correlate with $A_{r,\rm SFD}$ for $A_{r,\rm SFD}<0.1$, as first discovered by Yahata et al. (2007) for SDSS DR4 galaxies. Next we construct an analytic model to compute the surface density of galaxies taking account of the contamination of their FIR emission. We adopt a log-normal probability distribution for the ratio of $100\mu {\rm m}$ and $r$-band luminosities of each galaxy, $y \equiv (\nu L)_{100\mu {\rm m}}/(\nu L)_r$. Then we search for the mean and r.m.s values of $y$ that fit the observed anomaly using the analytic model. The required values to reproduce the anomaly are roughly consistent with those measured from the stacking analysis of SDSS galaxies (Kashiwagi, Yahata, & Suto 2013). Due to the limitation of our statistical modeling, we are not yet able to remove the FIR contamination of galaxies from the extinction map. Nevertheless the agreement with the model prediction suggests that the FIR emission of galaxies is mainly responsible for the observed anomaly. While the corresponding systematic error in the Galactic extinction map is 0.1 to 1mmag, it is directly correlated with galaxy clustering, and thus needs to be carefully examined in precision cosmology.",astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA,"Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics, Astrophysics of Galaxies","Modeling the anomaly of surface number densities of galaxies on the   Galactic extinction map due to their FIR emission contamination

We confirm that the surface densities of those galaxies positively correlate with $A_{r,\rm SFD}$ for $A_{r,\rm SFD}<0.1$, as first discovered by Yahata et al. (2007) for SDSS DR4 galaxies. Next we construct an analytic model to compute the surface density of galaxies taking account of the contamination of their FIR emission. We adopt a log-normal probability distribution for the ratio of $100\mu {\rm m}$ and $r$-band luminosities of each galaxy, $y \equiv (\nu L)_{100\mu {\rm m}}/(\nu L)_r$. Then we search for the mean and r.m.s values of $y$ that fit the observed anomaly using the analytic model. The required values to reproduce the anomaly are roughly consistent with those measured from the stacking analysis of SDSS galaxies (Kashiwagi, Yahata, & Suto 2013). Due to the limitation of our statistical modeling, we are not yet able to remove the FIR contamination of galaxies from the extinction map. Nevertheless the agreement with the model prediction suggests that the FIR emission of galaxies is mainly responsible for the observed anomaly. While the corresponding systematic error in the Galactic extinction map is 0.1 to 1mmag, it is directly correlated with galaxy clustering, and thus needs to be carefully examined in precision cosmology."
1510.00271,Parametrizations of the global 21-cm signal and parameter estimation   from single-dipole experiments,"One approach to extracting the global 21-cm signal from total-power measurements at low radio frequencies is to parametrize the different contributions to the data and then fit for these parameters. We examine parametrizations of the 21-cm signal itself, and propose one based on modelling the Lyman-alpha background, IGM temperature and hydrogen ionized fraction using tanh functions. This captures the shape of the signal from a physical modelling code better than an earlier parametrization based on interpolating between maxima and minima of the signal, and imposes a greater level of physical plausibility. This allows less biased constraints on the turning points of the signal, even though these are not explicitly fit for. Biases can also be alleviated by discarding information which is less robustly described by the parametrization, for example by ignoring detailed shape information coming from the covariances between turning points or from the high-frequency parts of the signal, or by marginalizing over the high-frequency parts of the signal by fitting a more complex foreground model. The fits are sufficiently accurate to be usable for experiments gathering 1000 h of data, though in this case it may be important to choose observing windows which do not include the brightest areas of the foregrounds.

1409.1640,The effect of macromodel uncertainties on microlensing modelling of   lensed quasars,"Cosmological gravitational microlensing has been proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the structure of multiply imaged quasars, especially the accretion disc and central supermassive black-hole system. However, the derived constraints on models may be affected by large systematic errors introduced in the various stages of modelling, namely, the macromodels, the microlensing magnification maps, and the convolution with realistic disc profiles. In particular, it has been known that different macromodels of the galaxy lens that fit the observations equally well, can lead to different values of convergence, $\kappa$, and shear, $\gamma$, required to generate magnification maps. So far, 25 microlensed quasars have been studied using microlensing techniques, where each system has been modelled and analyzed individually, or in small samples. This is about to change due to the upcoming synoptic all-sky surveys, which are expected to discover thousands of quasars suitable for microlensing studies.

The expected boon in high-resolution HI data by the planned MeerKAT, ASKAP and WSRT/APERTIF radio observatories will reveal the importance of mergers in the local Universe and, with the advent of SKA, over cosmic times."

The ring-shaped relic has a steeper spectral index ($\alpha$) of -1.74$\pm$0.29 in the frequency range 100 - 600 MHz. We propose this relic to be an old plasma revived due to adiabatic compression by the outgoing shock which produced the elongated relic."

1012.4656,Preheating after Small-Field Inflation,"Whereas preheating after chaotic and hybrid inflation models has been abundantly studied in the literature, preheating in small field inflation models, where the curvature of the inflaton potential is negative during inflation, remains less explored. In these models, a tachyonic instability at the end of inflation leads to a succession of exponentially large increases and \emph{decreases} of the inflaton fluctuations as the inflaton condensate oscillates around the minimum of its potential. The net effect is a competition between low-momentum modes which grow and decrease significantly, and modes with higher momenta which grow less but also decrease less. We develop an analytical description of this process, which is analogous to the quantum mechanical problem of tunneling through a volcano-shaped potential. Depending on the parameters, preheating may be so efficient that it completes in less than one oscillation of the inflaton condensate. Preheating after small field inflation may also be followed by a long matter-dominated stage before the universe thermalizes, depending on the energy scale of inflation and the details of the inflaton interactions. Finally, another feature of these models is that the spectrum of the inflaton fluctuations at the end of preheating may be peaked around the Hubble scale. In fact, because preheating starts when the second slow-roll parameter $|\eta|$ becomes of order unity while the first slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$ is still much smaller than one, the universe is still inflating during preheating and the modes amplified by the initial tachyonic instability leave the Hubble radius.

We find a novel interplay between the co-annihilation and the weak interaction in deciding the ($n/p$) ratio and the yield of $\chi$. Large co-annihilation strength ($G_D$) in comparison to the weak coupling ($G_F$), potentially can alter the number of nucleons in the thermal bath modifying the ($n/p$) ratio from its standard evolution. We find that the standard BBN prediction is restored for $G_D/G_F \lesssim 10^{-2}$, while the mass of $\chi$ being much smaller than the neutron mass. When the mass of $\chi$ is comparable to the neutron mass, we can allow large $G_D/G_F ~(\gtrsim 10^2)$ values, as the thermal abundance of $\chi$ becomes Boltzmann-suppressed. Therefore, the ($n/p$) ratio is restored to its standard value via dominant weak processes in later epochs. We also discuss the stability of the new particle in an effective theroy framework for co-annihilation.

Here, we extend the study of magnetic field amplification by cosmic-ray driven turbulence to weak shocks. The amplification is driven by turbulence that is produced by the cosmic-ray pressure acting on the density inhomogeneities in the upstream fluid. The clumping that has been inferred from X-ray data for the outskirts of galaxy clusters could provide some of the seed inhomogeneities. Magnetic field power spectra and Faraday maps are produced. Furthermore, we investigate how the synchrotron emission in the shock precursor can be used to verify the existence of this instability and constrain essential plasma parameters."

The observational characteristics of the different stages of ram pressure stripping are presented. The dynamical models yield the 3D velocity vectors of the galaxies, peak ram pressures, and times to peak ram pressure. In the case of a smooth, static, and spherical intracluster medium, peak ram pressure occurs during the galaxy's closest approach to the cluster center, i.e. when the galaxy's velocity vector is perpendicular to its distance vector from the cluster center (M 87). Assuming this condition the galaxy's present line-of-sight distance and its 3D position during peak ram pressure can be calculated. The linear orbital segments derived in this way together with the intracluster medium density distribution derived from X-ray observations give estimates of the ram pressure that are on average a factor of 2 higher than derived from the dynamical simulations for NGC 4501, NGC 4330, and NGC 4569. Resolving this discrepancy would require either a 2 times higher intracluster medium density than derived from X-ray observations, or a 2 times higher stripping efficiency than assumed by the dynamical models.

0911.0053,Evidence for the accelerated expansion of the Universe from weak lensing   tomography with COSMOS,"We present a tomographic cosmological weak lensing analysis of the HST COSMOS Survey. Applying our lensing-optimized data reduction, principal component interpolation for the ACS PSF, and improved modelling of charge-transfer inefficiency, we measure a lensing signal which is consistent with pure gravitational modes and no significant shape systematics. We carefully estimate the statistical uncertainty from simulated COSMOS-like fields obtained from ray-tracing through the Millennium Simulation. We test our pipeline on simulated space-based data, recalibrate non-linear power spectrum corrections using the ray-tracing, employ photometric redshifts to reduce potential contamination by intrinsic galaxy alignments, and marginalize over systematic uncertainties.

 We present a tomographic cosmological weak lensing analysis of the HST COSMOS Survey. Applying our lensing-optimized data reduction, principal component interpolation for the ACS PSF, and improved modelling of charge-transfer inefficiency, we measure a lensing signal which is consistent with pure gravitational modes and no significant shape systematics. We carefully estimate the statistical uncertainty from simulated COSMOS-like fields obtained from ray-tracing through the Millennium Simulation. We test our pipeline on simulated space-based data, recalibrate non-linear power spectrum corrections using the ray-tracing, employ photometric redshifts to reduce potential contamination by intrinsic galaxy alignments, and marginalize over systematic uncertainties.

The aim of this study is to constrain the nature of the nuclear region (starburst or AGN) within NGC 4418 via very-high-resolution radio imaging. Archival data from radio observations using the EVN and MERLIN interferometers are imaged. Sizes and flux densities are obtained by fitting Gaussian intensity distributions to the image. The average spectral index of the compact radio emission is estimated from measurements at 1.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz. The nuclear structure of NGC 4418 visible with EVN and MERLIN consists of eight compact (<49 mas i.e. <8 pc) features spread within a region of 250 mas, i.e. 41 pc.

 Using a compilation of 379 massive (stellar mass M > 10^{11} M_Sun) spheroid-like galaxies from the near-infrared Palomar/DEEP-2 survey, we have probed, up to z~1, whether the presence of companions depends on the size of the host galaxies. We have explored the presence of companions with mass ratios down to 1:10 and 1:100, with respect to the central massive galaxy, and within a projected distance of 30, 50 and 100 kpc of these objects. We find evidence for these companions being equally distributed around both compact and extended massive spheroids.

1604.05714,ALMA suggests outflows in z~5.5 galaxies,"We present the first attempt to detect outflows from galaxies approaching the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) using a sample of 9 star-forming ($\rm SFR=31\pm 20~M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$) $z\sim 5.5$ galaxies for which the [CII]158$\mu$m line has been previously obtained with ALMA. We first fit each line with a Gaussian function and compute the residuals by subtracting the best fitting model from the data. We combine the residuals of all sample galaxies and find that the total signal is characterised by a flux excess of $\sim 0.5$ mJy extended over $\sim 1000$ km~s$^{-1}$. Although we cannot exclude that part of this signal is due to emission from faint satellite galaxies, we show that the most probable explanation for the detected flux excess is the presence of broad wings in the [CII] lines, signatures of starburst-driven outflows. We infer an average outflow rate of $\rm \dot{M}=54\pm23~ M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$, providing a loading factor $\eta=\rm \dot{M}/SFR=1.7\pm1.3$ in agreement with observed local starbursts. Our interpretation is consistent with outcomes from zoomed hydro-simulations of {\it Dahlia}, a $z\sim 6$ galaxy ($\rm SFR\sim 100~\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$) whose feedback-regulated star formation results into an outflow rate $\rm \dot{M}\sim 30~ M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$.

1212.2641,Slow-Roll Inflation Preceded by a Topological Defect Phase \`a la   Chaplygin Gas,"We present a simple toy model corresponding to a network of frustrated topological defects of domain walls or cosmic strings that exist previous to the standard slow-roll inflationary era of the universe. Such a network (i) can produce a slower inflationary era than that of the standard scenario if it corresponds to a network of frustrated domain walls or (ii) can induce a vanishing universal acceleration; i.e., the universe would expand at a constant speed, if it corresponds to a network of frustrated cosmic strings red. Those features are phenomenologically modeled by a Chaplygin gas that can interpolate between a network of frustrated topological defects and a de Sitter-like or a power-law inflationary era. We show that this scenario can alleviate the quadruple anomaly of the cosmic microwave background spectrum. Using the method of the Bogoliubov coefficients, we obtain the spectrum of the gravitational waves as would be measured today for the whole range of frequencies.

1307.7136,The long lives of giant clumps and the birth of outflows in gas-rich   galaxies at high redshift,"Star-forming disk galaxies at high redshift are often subject to violent disk instability, characterized by giant clumps whose fate is yet to be understood. The main question is whether the clumps disrupt within their dynamical timescale (<50Myr), like molecular clouds in today's galaxies, or whether they survive stellar feedback for more than a disk orbital time (~300Myr) in which case they can migrate inward and help building the central bulge. We present 3.5-7pc resolution AMR simulations of high-redshift disks including photo-ionization, radiation pressure, and supernovae feedback (Renaud et al. 2013, and Perret et al., this astro-ph issue). Our modeling of radiation pressure determines the mass loading and initial velocity of winds from basic physical principles. We find that the giant clumps produce steady outflow rates comparable to and sometimes somewhat larger than their star formation rate, with velocities largely sufficient to escape galaxy. The clumps also lose mass, especially old stars, by tidal stripping, and the stellar populations contained in the clumps hence remain relatively young (<=200Myr), as observed. The clumps survive gaseous outflows and stellar loss, because they are wandering in gas-rich turbulent disks from which they can re-accrete gas at high rates compensating for outflows and tidal stripping, overall keeping realistic and self-regulated gaseous and stellar masses. Our simulations produce gaseous outflows with velocities, densities and mass loading consistent with observations, and at the same time suggest that the giant clumps survive for hundreds of Myr and complete their migration to the center of high-redshift galaxies, without rapid dispersion and reformation of clumps.",astro-ph.CO astro-ph.GA,"Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics, Astrophysics of Galaxies","The long lives of giant clumps and the birth of outflows in gas-rich   galaxies at high redshift

We perform high-resolution simulations in three dimensions, including a realistic non-equilibrium treatment of the ionization state of the gas, and examine both driven and decaying turbulence. This allows us to explore variations in the metallicity Z. In this paper, we study solar metallicity, Z=Z_sun, and low metallicity, Z=1d-3 Z_sun, gas. For driven, large-scale turbulence, we find that the influence of the metallicity on the amount of mass in the cold gas component is small. However, in decaying turbulent conditions this picture is much changed. While cold regions survive in the case of solar metallicity, they are quickly heated and dispersed in low-metallicity gas. This result suggests that star formation can be suppressed in environments of low metallicity, unless a strong turbulent driver is acting on time scales shorter than a few turbulent crossing times.

We perform high-resolution simulations in three dimensions, including a realistic non-equilibrium treatment of the ionization state of the gas, and examine both driven and decaying turbulence. This allows us to explore variations in the metallicity Z. In this paper, we study solar metallicity, Z=Z_sun, and low metallicity, Z=1d-3 Z_sun, gas. For driven, large-scale turbulence, we find that the influence of the metallicity on the amount of mass in the cold gas component is small. However, in decaying turbulent conditions this picture is much changed. While cold regions survive in the case of solar metallicity, they are quickly heated and dispersed in low-metallicity gas. This result suggests that star formation can be suppressed in environments of low metallicity, unless a strong turbulent driver is acting on time scales shorter than a few turbulent crossing times. Inter alia this finding could explain the overall inefficient star formation as well as the burst-like mode of star formation found in metal-poor, gas-rich systems like dwarf galaxies."

The tachyonic instability occurring along the direction of the accompanying non-inflaton field can be cured by expanding the kinetic part of the frame function up to the fourth order in powers of the various fields. In the case of a gauge non-singlet inflaton, though, a conjugation symmetry has to be imposed on these terms in order for the flatness of the inflationary potential is maintained.

The   Dependence of Submillimeter Flux Density on Star Formation Rate and Dust Mass,"We perform 3-D dust radiative transfer (RT) calculations on hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging disk galaxies in order to quantitatively study the dependence of observed-frame submillimeter (submm) flux density on galaxy properties. We find that submm flux density and star formation rate (SFR) are related in dramatically different ways for quiescently star-forming galaxies and starbursts. Because the stars formed in the merger-induced starburst do not dominate the bolometric luminosity and the rapid drop in dust mass and more compact geometry cause a sharp increase in dust temperature during the burst, starbursts are very inefficient at boosting submm flux density (e.g., a $\ga16$x boost in SFR yields a $\la 2$x boost in submm flux density). Moreover, the ratio of submm flux density to SFR differs significantly between the two modes; thus one cannot assume that the galaxies with highest submm flux density are necessarily those with the highest bolometric luminosity or SFR. These results have important consequences for the bright submillimeter-selected galaxy (SMG) population. Among them are: 1. The SMG population is heterogeneous. In addition to merger-driven starbursts, there is a subpopulation of galaxy pairs, where two disks undergoing a major merger but not yet strongly interacting are blended into one submm source because of the large ($\ga 15$"", or $\sim 130$ kpc at $z = 2$) beam of single-dish submm telescopes. 2.

2108.10727,Gravitational Waves from the Cosmological Quark-Hadron Phase Transition   Revisited,"The recent claim by the NANOGrav collaboration of a possible detection of an isotropic gravitational wave background stimulated a series of investigations searching for the origin of such a signal. The QCD phase transition appears as a natural candidate and in this paper the gravitational spectrum generated during the conversion of quarks into hadrons is calculated. Here, contrary to recent studies, equations of state for the quark-gluon plasma issued from the lattice approach were adopted. The duration of the transition, an important parameter affecting the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum, was estimated self-consistently with the dynamics of the universe controlled by the Einstein equations.

 The recent claim by the NANOGrav collaboration of a possible detection of an isotropic gravitational wave background stimulated a series of investigations searching for the origin of such a signal. The QCD phase transition appears as a natural candidate and in this paper the gravitational spectrum generated during the conversion of quarks into hadrons is calculated. Here, contrary to recent studies, equations of state for the quark-gluon plasma issued from the lattice approach were adopted. The duration of the transition, an important parameter affecting the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum, was estimated self-consistently with the dynamics of the universe controlled by the Einstein equations.

The presence of a few bright supergiants in the galaxy indicates that the current star formation process is weak. The apparent distribution of stars with different ages in VV 124 does not differ from the analogous distributions of stars in irregular galaxies, but the ratio of the numbers of young and old stars indicates that VV 124 belongs to the rare Irr/Sph type of galaxies. The old stars (red giants) form the most extended structure, a thick disk with an exponential decrease in the star number density to the edge. Definitely, the young population unresolvable in images makes a great contribution to the background emission from the central galactic regions. The presence of young stars is also confirmed by the [O III] emission line visible in the spectra that belongs to extensive diffuse galactic regions. The mean radial velocity of several components (two bright supergiants, the unresolvable stellar population, and the diffuse gas) is v_h = -70+/-15 km/s and the velocity with which VV 124 falls into the Local Group is v_LG = -12+/-15 km/s.

 We present the results of our stellar photometry and spectroscopy for the new Local Group galaxy VV 124 (UGC 4879) obtained with the 6-m BTA telescope. The presence of a few bright supergiants in the galaxy indicates that the current star formation process is weak. The apparent distribution of stars with different ages in VV 124 does not differ from the analogous distributions of stars in irregular galaxies, but the ratio of the numbers of young and old stars indicates that VV 124 belongs to the rare Irr/Sph type of galaxies. The old stars (red giants) form the most extended structure, a thick disk with an exponential decrease in the star number density to the edge. Definitely, the young population unresolvable in images makes a great contribution to the background emission from the central galactic regions. The presence of young stars is also confirmed by the [O III] emission line visible in the spectra that belongs to extensive diffuse galactic regions. The mean radial velocity of several components (two bright supergiants, the unresolvable stellar population, and the diffuse gas) is v_h = -70+/-15 km/s and the velocity with which VV 124 falls into the Local Group is v_LG = -12+/-15 km/s.

In this work we investigate the ability of these models to generate fields in two astrophysical contexts: dark matter mass density fields from cosmological simulations and images of interstellar dust. We examine the fidelity of the sampled cosmological fields relative to the true fields using three different metrics, and identify potential issues to address. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept application of the model trained on dust in denoising dust images.

1005.0883,Testing large-angle deviation from Gaussianity in CMB maps,"A detection of the level of non-Gaussianity in the CMB data is essential to discriminate among inflationary models and also to test alternative primordial scenarios. However, the extraction of primordial non-Gaussianity is a difficult endeavor since several effects of non-primordial nature can produce non-Gaussianity. On the other hand, different statistical tools can in principle provide information about distinct forms of non-Gaussianity. Thus, any single statistical estimator cannot be sensitive to all possible forms of non-Gaussianity. In this context, to shed some light in the potential sources of deviation from Gaussianity in CMB data it is important to use different statistical indicators. In a recent paper we proposed two new large-angle non-Gaussianity indicators which provide measures of the departure from Gaussianity on large angular scales. We used these indicators to carry out analyses of non-Gaussianity of the bands and of the foreground-reduced WMAP maps with and without the KQ75 mask. Here we briefly review the formulation of the non-Gaussianity indicators, and discuss the analyses made by using our indicators.",astro-ph.CO gr-qc hep-th,"Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics, General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology, High Energy Physics - Theory","Testing large-angle deviation from Gaussianity in CMB maps

1201.6362,Gravity Waves Seeded by Turbulence and Magnetic Fields From a First   Order Phase Transition With Non-Renormalizable Electroweak Vacua,"It is widely believed that the standard model is a low energy effective theory which may have higher dimensional non-renormalizable operators. The existence of these new operators can lead to interesting dynamics for the evolution of the universe, including the appearance of new vacuum states. If the universe today exists in a false vacuum, there will be a non-zero probability to tunnel to the true vacuum state of the universe. Should this transition occur elsewhere in the universe, bubbles of true vacuum will nucleate and expand outwards. Bubbles that nucleate in the hot dense plasma of the early universe will feel a friction from the plasma that acts against the expansion of the bubble, until the bubble eventually reaches a steady state expansion. Unlike many bubble formation scenarios where the bubble wall velocity rapidly approaches the speed of light, friction from the hot primordial plasma can cause the expanding bubble wall to reach a terminal velocity while gravity waves are free to propagate through the hot dense plasma at the speed of light. We analyze the effects of friction on the spectrum of gravity waves caused by bubble collisions. We find that a phase transition in a model with $\phi^6$ and $\phi^8$ operators that proceeds via a detonation in the hot plasma of the early universe is unlikely.

2002.06988,Anisotropic Fluid Cosmology: an Alternative to Dark Matter?,"We use anisotropic fluid cosmology to describe the present, dark energy-dominated, universe. Similarly to what has been proposed for galactic dynamics, the anisotropic fluid gives an effective description of baryonic matter, dark energy and their possible interaction, without assuming the presence of dark matter. The resulting anisotropic fluid spacetime naturally generates inhomogeneities at small scales, triggered by an anisotropic stress, and could therefore be responsible for structure formation at these scales. Solving the cosmological equations, we show that the dynamics of the scale factor $a$ is described by usual FLRW cosmology and decouples completely from that describing inhomogeneities. We assume that the cosmological anisotropic fluid inherits the equation of state from that used to describe galaxy rotation curves. We show that, in the large scale regime, the fluid can be described as a generalized Chaplygin gas and fits well the distance modulus experimental data of type Ia supernovae, thus correctly modelling the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. Conversely, in the small scale regime, we use cosmological perturbation theory to derive the power spectrum $P(k)$ for mass density distribution.

In this work, we employ the Gaussian processes (GP) algorithm to perform a joint analysis by using the geometrical cosmological probes such as Cosmic chronometers, Supernova Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and the H0LiCOW lenses sample to infer a reconstruction of the coupling function between the dark components in a general framework, where the DE can assume a dynamical character via its equation of state. In addition to the joint analysis with these data, we simulate a catalogue with standard siren events from binary neutron star mergers, within the sensitivity predicted by the Einstein Telescope, to reconstruct the dark sector coupling with more accuracy in a robust way. We find that the particular case, where $w = -1$ is fixed on the DE nature, has a statistical preference for an interaction in the dark sector at late times. In the general case, where $w(z)$ is analysed, we find no evidence for such dark coupling, and the predictions are compatible with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

1006.3789,Quasar bolometric corrections: theoretical considerations,"Bolometric corrections based on the optical-to-ultraviolet continuum spectrum of quasars are widely used to quantify their radiative output, although such estimates are affected by a myriad of uncertainties, such as the generally unknown line-of-sight angle to the central engine. In order to shed light on these issues, we investigate the state-of-the-art models of Hubeny et al. that describe the continuum spectrum of thin accretion discs and include relativistic effects. We explore the bolometric corrections as a function of mass accretion rates, black hole masses and viewing angles, restricted to the parameter space expected for type-1 quasars. We find that a nonlinear relationship log L_bol=A + B log(lambda L_lambda) with B<=0.9 is favoured by the models and becomes tighter as the wavelength decreases. We calculate from the model the bolometric corrections corresponding to the wavelengths lambda = 1450A, 3000A and 5100A. In particular, for lambda=3000A we find A=9.24 +- 0.77 and B=0.81 +- 0.02. We demonstrate that the often-made assumption that quasars emit isotropically may lead to severe systematic errors in the determination of L_bol, when using the method of integrating the ""big blue bump"" spectrum. For a typical viewing angle of ~30 degrees to the quasar central engine, we obtain that the value of L_bol resulting from the isotropy assumption has a systematic error of ~30% high compared to the value of L_bol which incorporates the anisotropic emission of the accretion disc.
