## CosmologyAI

### This repository is intended to be a collection of various Data Science, Data Analytics, AI and LLM-based experiments (RAG, Fine-Tuning) in the Cosmology and Extragalactic Astronomy domain

### So far:
#### 1. Assemble Cosmology-related abstracts from the ArXiv dataset (Kaggle, Cornell) - Notebook and script (get_cosmo_data_from_arxiv.*) uploaded to **arxiv_project/code**
  
#### 2. Build a basic Extractive QA (No memory) with LangChain and Ollama embeddings, run it locally on a Mac, use Groq for LPU, Gradio for the interface - Notebook and script (chatbot_cmb_basic.*) uploaded to **cmb_rag/code**. Relevant CMB review papers are in **cmb_rag/cmb_data**

#### 3. Create vectordb and persist it using Chroma and the Cosmology arxiv abstracts (~66k abstracts) - Notebook and script (create_cosmo_vectordb.*) uploaded to  **arxiv_project/code**

#### 4. Code to take the assembled dataset and build a RAG Extractive QA system utilizing Mistral 7b, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, LangChain and ChromadB - Notebook to be uploaded
  
#### 5. Using the same techstack, build a context-based retrieval search - Notebook to be uploaded

### Next Steps:
* Use Bonito, make instruction-tuned dataset to evaluate RAG application
* Evaluate RAG application using RAGAS
* Explore alternative ways to evaluate RAG application
* Visualize RAG application
* Explore fine-tuning an LLM using instruction-tuned dataset
* Evaluate fine-tuned LLM vs pre-trained
* Explore Advanced RAG (Reranking etc) using both LangChain and LlamaIndex
* Explore context evaluation using TruLens
* Explore different fine-tuning methods, perhaps DPO if we can build a Cosmology preference dataset
* Try DSPy for RAG
* Create a proper chatbot with memory
* Get the paper text and build datasets with that
* Build full applications (RAG, Fine-tuning) based on full paper texts
