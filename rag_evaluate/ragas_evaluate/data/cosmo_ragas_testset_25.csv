What is the potential of future SKA-era PTAs in detecting supermassive black hole binaries?,"['Prospects for Constraining interacting dark energy cosmology with   gravitational-wave bright sirens detected by future SKA-era pulsar timing   arrays \n Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have the potential to detect Nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs) that are usually generated by the individual inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the galactic centers. The GW signals as cosmological standard sirens can provide the absolute cosmic distances, thereby can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we analyze the ability of future SKA-era PTAs to detect the existing SMBHBs candidates assuming the root mean square of timing noise $\\sigma_t=20\\ {\\rm ns}$, and use the simulated PTA data to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models with energy transfer rate $Q = \\beta H\\rho_c$.

What are the potential constraints on the nature of dark energy that can be obtained from future surveys in strong lensing time delay observations?,"['Strong Lensing Time Delay Constraints on Dark Energy: a Forecast \n Measurements of time delays between multiple quasar images produced by strong lensing are reaching a sensitivity that makes them a promising cosmological probe.

How can upcoming photometric large scale structure surveys be optimized to measure modifications to gravity on cosmic scales?,"['Optimising cosmic shear surveys to measure modifications to gravity on   cosmic scales \n We consider how upcoming photometric large scale structure surveys can be optimized to measure the properties of dark energy and possible cosmic scale modifications to General Relativity in light of realistic astrophysical and instrumental systematic uncertainities.

We study the impact of survey tradeoffs in depth versus breadth, and redshift quality. We parameterise the results in terms of the Dark Energy Task Force figure of merit, and deviations from General Relativity through an analagous Modified Gravity figure of merit.

While reducing photometric redshift scatter improves constraining power, the dependence is shallow. The variation in constraining power is stronger once IAs are included and is slightly more pronounced for MG constraints than for DE.
