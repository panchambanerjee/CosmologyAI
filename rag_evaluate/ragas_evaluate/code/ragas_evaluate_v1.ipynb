       "Document(page_content=\"Non-Minimal Quintessence With Nearly Flat Potential \\n We consider Brans-Dicke type nonminimally coupled scalar field as a candidate for dark energy. In the conformally transformed Einstein's frame, our model is similar to {\\\\it coupled quintessence} model. In such models, we consider potentials for the scalar field which satisfy the slow-roll conditions: $[(1/V)(dV/d\\\\phi)]^2 << 1$ and $(1/V)(d^2V/d\\\\phi^2) << 1$. For such potentials, we show that the equation of state for the scalar field can be described by a universal behaviour, provided the scalar field rolls only in the flat part of the potentials where the slow-roll conditions are satisfied.

In this contribution, we discuss the possibility of identifying and studying such `resolved' binaries through their electromagnetic emission. The host galaxies of such binaries are themselves expected to be also very massive and rare, so that out to redshifts z~2 a unique massive galaxy may be identified as the host. At higher redshifts, the PTA error boxes are larger and may contain as many as several hundred massive-galaxy interlopers. In this case, the true counterpart may be identified, if it is accreting gas efficiently, as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with a peculiar spectrum and variable emission features. Specifically, the binary's tidal torques expel the gas from the inner part of the accretion disk, making it unusually dim in X-ray and UV bands and in broad optical emission lines. The tails of the broad wings of any FeK-alpha emission line may also be `clipped' and missing. The binary's orbital motion, as well as the gas motions it induces, may trigger quasiperiodic variations. These include coherent flux variability, such as luminous, multi-wavelength flares, as well as Doppler shifts of broad emission lines and `see-saw' oscillations in the FeK-alpha line. Additional features, such as evidence for a recent major merger or dual collimated jets, could also corroborate the counterpart. These properties would make resolved PTA sources stand out among AGN with similar overall luminosities and allow their identification.\", 'cat_text': 'Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics', 'categories': 'astro-ph.CO', 'id': '1309.2302', 'title': 'Electromagnetic signatures of supermassive black hole binaries resolved   by PTAs'})"

The GW signals as cosmological standard sirens can provide the absolute cosmic distances, thereby can be used to constrain the cosmological parameters. In this paper, we analyze the ability of future SKA-era PTAs to detect the existing SMBHBs candidates assuming the root mean square of timing noise $\\\\\\\\sigma_t=20\\\\\\\\ {\\\\\\\\rm ns}$, and use the simulated PTA data to constrain the interacting dark energy (IDE) models with energy transfer rate $Q = \\\\\\\\beta H\\\\\\\\rho_c$. We find that, the future SKA-era PTAs will play an important role in constraining the IDE cosmology. Using only the mock PTA data consisting of 100 pulsars, we obtain $\\\\\\\\sigma(H_0)=0.239\\\\\\\\ {\\\\\\\\rm km} \\\\\\\\ {\\\\\\\\rm s}^{-1} {\\\\\\\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $\\\\\\\\sigma(\\\\\\\\Omega_m)=0.0103$ in the I$\\\\\\\\Lambda$CDM model, which are much better than the results from the Planck TT, TE, EE+lowE. However, the PTA data cannot provide a tight constraint on the coupling parameter $\\\\\\\\beta$ compared with Planck, but the data combination of Planck+PTA can provide a rather tight constraint, i.e., $\\\\\\\\sigma(\\\\\\\\beta)=0.00232$, since the PTA data could break the parameter degeneracies inherent in CMB. In the I$w$CDM model, we obtain $\\\\\\\\sigma(\\\\\\\\beta)=0.00137$ and $\\\\\\\\sigma(w)=0.0492$ from the Planck+PTA data combination. In addition, we also find that with the increase of the number of pulsars in PTA, the constraint results from the Planck+PTA will be further improved to some extent. We show that the observations of Nanohertz GWs with future SKA-era PTAs will provide a powerful tool for exploring the nature of dark energy and measuring the coupling between dark energy and dark matter.']\""
